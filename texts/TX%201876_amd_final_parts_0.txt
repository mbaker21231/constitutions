Section 2. HOME RULE.  (1) Holding the belief that the highest degree of local self-
government which is consistent with the efficient conduct of those affairs by necessity lodged in
the Nation and the State will prove most responsive to the will of the people, and result to
reward their diligence and intelligence by greater economy and efficiency in their local
government affairs, it is hereby ordained:
     (2) Any county having a population of sixty-two thousand (62,000) or more according to
the latest Federal census may adopt a county home rule charter, to embrace those powers
appropriate hereto, within the specific limitations hereinafter provided.  It is further provided
that the Legislature, by a favoring vote of two-thirds of the total membership of both the Senate
and the House of Representatives, may authorize any county, having a population less than that
above specified, to proceed hereunder for the adoption of a charter; however, as a condition for
such authorization, it is required that notice of the intent to seek legislative authority hereunder
must be published in one or more newspapers, to give general circulation in the county affected,
not less than once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks, and the first of such publications
shall appear not less than thirty (30) days prior to the time an act making proposal hereunder
may be introduced in the Legislature.  No county home rule charter may be adopted by any
county save upon a favoring vote of the resident qualifying electors of the affected county.  In
elections, submitting to the voters a proposal to adopt a charter (unless otherwise provided by a
two-thirds vote of the total membership of each house of the Legislature) the votes cast by the
qualified electors residing within the limits of all the incorporated cities and towns of the county
shall be separately kept but collectively counted and the votes of the qualified electors of the
county who do not reside within the limits of any incorporated city or town likewise shall be
separately kept and separately counted, and unless there shall be a favoring majority of the votes
cast without such collective cities and towns, the charter shall not be adopted.  It is expressly
forbidden that any such charter may inconstantly affect the operation of the general laws of the
State relating to the judicial, tax, fiscal, educational, police, highway and health systems, or any
other department of the State's superior government.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed
to authorize the adoption of a charter provision inimical to or inconsistent with the sovereignty
and established public policies of this State, and no provision having such vice shall have
validity as against the State.  No charter provision may operate to impair the exemption of
homesteads as established by the Constitution and the status relating thereto.
     (3)a. A charter hereunder may provide: the continuance of a County Commissioners'
Court, as now constituted, to serve as the governing body of a county to operate hereunder; or,
may provide for a governing body otherwise constituted, which shall be elective, and service
therein shall be upon such qualifications, for such terms, under such plan of representation, and
upon such conditions of tenure and compensation as may be fixed by any such charter.  The
terms of service in such governing body may exceed two (2) years, but shall not exceed six (6)
years.  In any event, in addition to the powers and duties provided by any such charter such
governing body shall exercise all powers and discharge all duties which, in the absence of the
provisions hereof, would devolve by law on County Commissioners and County
Commissioners' Courts.  Further, any such charter may provide for the organization,
reorganization, establishment and administration of the government of the county, including the
control and regulation of the performance of and the compensation for all duties required in the
conduct of the county affairs, subject to the limitations herein provided.
     b. A Charter hereunder may provide that Judges of County Courts (including that County
Court designated in this Constitution), and Justices of the Peace be compensated upon a salary
in lieu of fees.  The jurisdiction of the County Court designated in this Constitution, and the
duties of the Judges thereof, may be confined to that general jurisdiction of a probate Court
which elsewhere is defined in this Constitution.  The office of Justice of the Peace may be made
either elective or appointive.  Other than herein provided, no such Charter shall provide for
altering the jurisdiction or procedure of any Court.  The duties of District Attorney and/or
County Attorney may be confined to representing the State in civil cases to which the State is a
party and to enforcement of the State's Penal Code, and the compensation of said attorneys may
be fixed on a salary basis in lieu of fees.
     c. Save as hereinabove and hereinafter otherwise provided, such Charters, within the
limits expressed therein, may invest the governing body to be established for any county electing
to operate hereunder with the power to create, consolidate or abolish any office or department,
whether created by other provisions of the Constitutions or by statute, the duties thereof, fix the
compensation for service therein, make the same office elective or appointive and prescribe the
time, qualifications and conditions for tenure in any such office; save, that no such Charter other
than hereinabove authorized, shall provide to regulate the status, service, duties or compensation
of members of the Legislature, Judges of the Courts, District Attorneys, County Attorneys, or
any office whatever by the law of the State required to be filled by an election embracing more
than one county.  Excepting herefrom nominations, elections or appointments to offices, the
terms whereof may not have expired prior to the adoption of this Constitution, at such time as a
Charter provision adopted hereunder may be in effect (save as to those offices which must
continue to be elective, as herein elsewhere specified), all terms of county officers and all
contracts for the giving of service by deputies under such officers, may be subject to termination
by the administrative body of the county, under an adopted Charter so providing, and there shall
be no liability by reason thereof.
     d. Any county electing to operate hereunder shall have the power, by Charter provision,
to levy, assess and collect taxes, and to fix the maximum rate for ad valorem taxes to be levied
for specific purposes, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of this State, provided,
however, that the limit of the aggregate taxes which may be levied, assessed and collected
hereunder shall not exceed the limit or total fixed, or hereafter to be fixed, by this Constitution
to control counties, and the annual assessment upon property, both real, personal and mixed,
shall be at first superior and prior lien thereon.
     e. In addition to the powers herein provided, and in addition to the powers included in
the County Home Rule Charters, any county may, by a majority vote of the qualified electors of
said county, amend its Charter to include other powers, functions, duties and rights which now
or hereafter may be provided by this Constitution and the statutes of the State for counties.
     (4) Any county operating hereunder shall have the power to borrow money for all
purposes lawful under its Charter, to include the refunding of a lawful debt, in a manner
conforming to the General Laws of the State, and may issue therefor its obligations.  Such
obligations, other than those to refund a lawful debt, shall not be valid unless authorized by a
majority of all votes cast by those resident qualified voters of the area affected by the taxes
required to retire such obligation, who may vote thereon.  In case of county obligations,
maturing after a period of five (5) years, the same shall be issued to mature serially, fixing the
first maturity of principal at a time not to exceed two (2) years after the date of the issuance of
such obligations.  Such obligations may pledge the full faith and credit of the county; but in no
event shall the aggregate obligations so issued, in principal amount outstanding at any one time
exceed the then existing Constitutional limits for such obligations and such indebtedness and its
supporting tax shall constitute a first and superior lien upon the property taxable in such county. 
No obligation issued hereunder shall be valid unless prior to the time of the issuance thereof
there be levied a tax sufficient to retire the same as it matures, which tax shall not exceed the
then existing Constitutional limits.
     (5) Such Charter may authorize the governing body of a county operating hereunder to
prescribe the schedule of fees to be charged by the officers of the county for specified service, to
be in lieu of the schedule for such fees prescribed by the General Laws of the State; and, to
appropriate such fees to such funds as the Charter may prescribe; provided, however, no fee for
a specified service shall exceed in amount the fee fixed by General Law for that same service. 
Such Charter as to all judicial officers, other than District Judges, may prescribe the
qualifications for services, provided the standards therefor be not lower than those fixed by the
General Laws of this State.
     (6) a.  Subject to the express limitations upon the exercise of the powers by this
subdivision to be authorized, such Charters may provide (or omit to provide) that the
governmental and/or proprietary functions of any city, town, district or other defined political
subdivision (which is a governmental agency embraced within the boundaries of the county) be
transferred, either as to some or all the functions thereof, and yielded to the control of the
administrative body of the county.  No such transfer or yielding of functions may be effected
unless the proposal is submitted to a vote of the people, and unless otherwise provided by a two-
thirds vote of the total membership of each House of the Legislature, such a proposal shall be
submitted as a separate issue and the vote within and without any such city, town, district, or
other defined governmental entity, shall be separately cast and counted, and unless two-thirds of
the qualified votes cast within the yielding defined governmental entity, and a majority of the
qualified votes cast in the remainder of the county, favor the proposed merger, it shall not be
effected.  In case of the mergers hereby authorized, without the express Charter provision
therefor, in so far as it may be required to make effective the object of the proposed merger, the
county shall succeed to all the appropriate lawful powers, duties, rights, procedures, restrictions
and limitations which prior to the merger were reposed in, or imposed upon, the yielding
governmental agency.  Particularly, it is provided that the power to create funded indebtedness
and to levy taxes in support thereof may be exercised only by such procedures, and within such
limits, as now are, or hereafter may be, provided by law to control such appropriate other
governmental agencies were they to be independently administered.  Such mergers may be
effected under proposed contracts between the county and any such yielding agency, to be
approved at an election as hereinbefore provided for.  In order to increase governmental
efficiency and effect economy the county may contract with the principal city of the county to
perform one or more of its functions, provided such contracts shall not be valid for more than
two (2) years.
     b. In case of the partial or complete merger of the government of a city operating under
the Home Rule Charter, with the government of a county operating hereunder, those city Charter
provisions affected thereby shall cease to control, and the county Charter provision shall control.
     c. When any embraced incorporated city or town elects to merge its governmental
functions with those of the county under the provisions hereof, such Charter may provide for
defining or redefining the boundaries of such cities, such boundaries may be extended to include
only those areas contiguous to such cities as are urban in character; and as to such cities or
towns and for the benefit thereof the county, in addition to the primary city and county tax
herein authorized and any other lawful district tax, may levy and collect taxes upon the property
taxable within such city or town as defined or redefined, within the limits authorized by
Sections 4 and 5 of Article XI of this Constitution, (or any Amendment thereof) for incorporated
cities according to the population, provided that no tax greater than that existing at the time of
such merger or for any added purpose shall be imposed upon any such city or town unless
authorized by a majority of all votes cast by the resident qualified voters of such city or town.
     d. Areas urban in character, though not incorporated, under appropriate Charter
provision may be defined as such by the governing body of the county, provided, however, that
no portion of the county shall be defined as an urban area unless it has sufficient population to
entitle it to incorporate under the then existing laws of the State; and no such urban area, when
created, shall be vested with any taxing or bonding power which it would not possess if it were
operating as a separate incorporated unit under the then existing Constitutional and Statutory
provisions of this State; and provided further that the governing body of the county for the
government of all such areas shall have and exercise all powers and authority granted by law to
the governing bodies of similar areas when separately incorporated as a city or town, and such
areas shall be subject to additional taxation within the same Constitutional limits as control
taxation for a city or a town of like population.  Likewise such Charter may provide for the
governing board of the county subject to existing Constitutional and statutory provisions to
define, create and administer districts, and have and exercise the powers and authority granted
by the Constitution and laws relative to the same.
     (7) No provision of this Constitution inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3,
of Article IX, shall be held to control the provisions of a Charter adopted hereunder, and
conforming herewith.  Charters adopted hereunder shall make appropriate provision for the
abandonment, revocation, and amendment thereof, subject only to the requirements that there
must be a favoring majority of the vote cast upon such a proposal, by the qualified resident
electors of the county; and, no Charter may forbid amendments thereof for a time greater than

prescribed by Senate Bill No. 29, Chapter 318 of the Acts of the Fifty-first Legislature (provided
that when the limitation of Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) is used in said Senate Bill

interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now provided by law, or as may hereafter be
provided by law.

adopted by the people of Texas at the election held on November 13, 1951, and which have not
been used for repurchase of land as provided herein by the Veterans' Land Board from the sale of
lands and for interest on deferred payments, shall be credited to the Veterans' Land Fund for use
in purchasing additional lands to be sold to Texas Veterans of World War II, and to Texas
veterans of service in the armed forces of the United States of America subsequent to 1945, as
may be included within this program by legislative Act, in like manner as provided for the sale of

the sale of the lands and interest on deferred payments, or so much thereof as may be necessary,
shall be set aside for the retirement of bonds heretofore issued and to pay interest thereon, and
any of such monies not so needed shall not later than the maturity date of the last maturing bond

purposes as may be hereafter prescribed by law.  All bonds issued hereunder shall, after approval
by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the Comptroller of the State of Texas, and
delivery to the purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute obligations of the State under the

 Section 49- b.  VETERANS' LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUES; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
VETERANS' HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUND; VETERANS' HOUSING ASSISTANCE. 
There is hereby created a Board to be known as the Veterans' Land Board, which shall be
composed of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and two citizens of the State of
Texas who shall be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.    The
Governor shall biennially appoint one such member to serve for a term of four years, with the
initial appointments to the Board under this section to be for terms of two and four years,
respectively, and all subsequent appointments to be according to the provisions of this section. 
One such appointive member shall be well versed in veterans' affairs and the other such
appointive member shall be well versed in finances.  The Commissioner of the General Land
Office shall act as Chairman of the Board and shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land
Program under such terms and restrictions as may be provided by law.  The compensation for
said appointive members shall be as fixed by the Legislature, and shall make bond in such
amount as may be prescribed by the Legislature.  The Veterans' Land Board may issue not to
exceed Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) in bonds or obligations of the State of
Texas for the purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund.  Such bonds
shall be executed by said Board as an obligation of the State of Texas in such form,
denominations, and upon the terms as are now prescribed by law or as  may be hereafter be
provided by law; provided, however, that said bonds shall bear a rate of interest not to exceed
three per cent (3%) per annum, and that the same shall be sold for not less than par value and
accrued interest.
     In the sale of any such bonds, a preferential right of purchase shall be given to the
administrators of the various Teacher Retirement Funds, the Permanent University Funds, and
the Permanent School Funds; such bonds to be issued as needed in the opinion of the Veterans'
Land Board.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used for the sole purpose of purchasing lands suitable
for the purpose hereinafter stated, situated in this State, (a) owned by the United States, or any
governmental agency thereof; (b) owned by the Texas Prison System, or any other governmental
agency of the State of Texas; or (c) owned by any person, firm or corporation.  Provided,
however, the portion of the Veterans' Land Fund not immediately committed for the purchase of
lands may be invested in short term United States bonds or obligations until such funds are
needed for the purchase of lands.  The interest accruing thereon shall become a part of the
Veterans' Land Fund.
     All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in
cash, and shall be a part of the Veterans' Land Fund.
     The lands of the Veteran's Land Fund shall be sold by the State of Texas veterans of the
present war or wars, commonly known as World War II, and to Texas veterans of service in the
armed forces of the United States of America subsequent to 1945, as may be included within this
program by legislative Act, in such quantities, and on such terms, and at such prices and rates of
interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now provided by law, or as may hereafter be
provided by law.
     All moneys received and which have been received under the Constitutional Amendment
adopted by the people of Texas at the election held on November 13, 1951, and which have not
been used for repurchase of land as provided herein by the Veterans' Land Board from the sale of
lands and for interest on deferred payments, shall be credited to the Veterans' Land Fund for use
in purchasing additional lands to be sold to Texas Veterans of World War II, and to Texas
veterans of service in the armed forces of the United States of America subsequent to 1945, as
may be included within this program by legislative Act, in like manner as provided for the sale of
lands purchased with the proceeds from the sales of the bonds, provided for herein, for a period
ending December 1, 1959; provided, however, that so much of such monies as may be necessary
during the period ending December 1, 1959, to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds
heretofore issued and on bonds hereafter issued by the Veterans' Land Board, shall be set aside
for that purpose.  After December 1, 1959, all monies received by the Veterans' Land Board from
the sale of the lands and interest on deferred payments, or so much thereof as may be necessary,
shall be set aside for the retirement of bonds heretofore issued and to pay interest thereon, and
any of such monies not so needed shall not later than the maturity date of the last maturing bond
or bonds be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund to be appropriated to such
purposes as may be hereafter prescribed by law.  All bonds issued hereunder shall, after approval
by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the Comptroller of the State of Texas, and
delivery to the purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute obligations of the State under the
Constitution of Texas.  Of the total Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) of bonds
herein authorized, the sum of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) has heretofore been
issued; said bonds heretofore issued are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be
obligations of the State of Texas.

     The additional bonds herein authorized may be sold in such installments as deemed
necessary and advisable by the Veterans' Land Board.  All monies received from the sale of land
and for interest on deferred payments on land purchased with the proceeds of such additional
bonds, shall be credited to the Veterans' Land Fund for use in purchasing additional lands to be
sold to Texas veterans, as herein provided, in like manner as provided for the sale of lands
purchased with the proceeds from the sales of the bonds provided for herein, for a period ending
December 1, 1965; provided, however, that so much of such monies as may be necessary to pay
interest on the additional bonds herein provided for shall be set aside for that purpose.  After
December 1, 1965, all monies received by the Veterans' Land Board from the sale of the lands
and interest on payments, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be set aside for the
retirement of such additional bonds and to pay interest thereon, and any of such monies not so
needed shall not later than the maturity date of the last maturing bond be deposited to the credit
of the General Revenue Fund to be appropriated to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.

Section 49-c.  There is hereby created as an agency of the State of Texas the Texas Water
Development Board to exercise such powers as necessary under this provision together with such
other duties and restrictions as may be prescribed by law.  The qualifications, compensation, and
number of members of said Board shall be determined by law.  They shall be appointed by the
Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate in the manner and for such terms as may be
prescribed by law.
     The Texas Water Development Board shall have the authority to provide for, issue and
sell general obligation bonds of the State of Texas in an amount not to exceed One Hundred
Million Dollars ($100,000,000).  The Legislature of Texas, upon two-thirds (2/3) vote of the
elected members of each House may authorize the Board to issue additional bonds in an amount
not exceeding  One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000).  The bonds herein authorized or
permitted to be authorized by the Legislature shall be called "Texas Water Development Bonds,"
shall be executed in such form, denominations and upon such terms as may be prescribed by law,
provided, however, that the bonds shall not bear more than four per cent (4%) interest per
annum; they may be issued in such installments as the Board finds feasible and practical in
accomplishing the purpose set forth herein.
     All moneys received from the sale of State bonds shall be deposited in a fund known as
the Texas Water Development Fund to be administered (without further appropriation) by the
Texas Water Development Board in such manner as prescribed by law.
     Such fund shall be used only for the purpose of aiding or making funds available upon
such terms and conditions as the Legislature may prescribe, to the various political subdivisions
or bodies politic and corporate of the State of Texas including river authorities, conservation and
reclamation districts and districts created or organized or authorized to be created or organized
under Article XVI, Section 59 or Article III, Section 52 of this Constitution, interstate compact
commissions to which the State of Texas is a party and municipal corporations, in the
conservation and development of the water resources of this State, including the control, storing
and preservation of its storm and flood waters and the waters of its rivers and streams, for all
useful and lawful purposes by the acquisition, improvement, extension or construction of dams,
reservoirs and other water storage projects, including any system necessary for the transportation
of water from storage to points of treatment and/or distribution, including facilities for
transporting water therefrom to wholesale purchasers, or for any one or more of such purposes or
methods.
     Any or all financial assistance as provided herein shall be repaid with interest upon such
terms, conditions and manner of repayment as may be provided by law.  
     While any of the bonds authorized by this provision or while any of the bonds may be
authorized by the Legislature under this provision, or any interest on any such bonds, is
outstanding and unpaid, there is hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the
Treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount which is
sufficient to pay the principal and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such
fiscal year, less the amount in the sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year.
     The legislature may provide for the investment of moneys available in the Texas Water
Development Fund, and the interest and sinking funds established for the payment of bonds
issued by the Texas Water Development Board.  Income from such investment shall be used for
the purposes prescribed by the Legislature.  The Legislature may also make appropriations from
the General Revenue Fund for paying administrative expenses of the Board.
     From the moneys received by the Texas Water Development Board as repayment of the
principal for financial assistance or as interest thereon, there shall be deposited in the interest and
sinking fund for the bonds authorized by this Section sufficient moneys to pay the interest and
principal to become due during the ensuing year and sufficient to establish and maintain a reserve
in said fund equal to the average annual principal and interest requirements on all outstanding
bonds issued under this Section.  If any year prior to December 31, 1982 moneys are received in
excess of the foregoing requirements then such excess shall be deposited to the Texas Water
Development Fund, and may be used for administrative expenses of the Board and for the same
purposes and upon the same terms and conditions prescribed for the proceeds derived from the
sale of such State bonds.   No grant of financial assistance shall be made under the provisions of
this Section after December 31, 1982, and all moneys thereafter received as repayment of
principal for financial assistance or as interest thereon shall be deposited in the interest and
sinking fund for the State bonds; except that such amount as may be required to meet the
administrative expenses of the Board may be annually set aside; and provided, that after all State
bonds have been fully paid with interest, or after there are on deposit in the interest and sinking
fund sufficient moneys to pay all future maturities of principal and interest, additional moneys so
received shall be deposited to the General Revenue Fund. 
     All bonds issued hereunder shall after approval by the Attorney General, registration by
the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchaser, be
incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of Texas under the Constitution
of Texas.
     Should the Legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of the adoption of this
amendment, such acts shall not be void by reason of their anticipatory nature.

Sec. 5.  CITY OF AMARILLO; WICHITA COUNTY; JEFFERSON COUNTY; CREATION
AND FUNDING OF HOSPITAL DISTRICTS.  (a) The Legislature may by law authorize the
creation of two hospital districts, one to be coextensive with and have the same boundaries as the
incorporated City of Amarillo, as such boundaries now exist or as they may hereafter be lawfully
extended, and the other to be coextensive with Wichita County.
     If such district or districts are created, they may be authorized to levy a tax not to exceed
Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation of taxable property
within the district; provided, however, no tax may be levied until approved by a majority vote of
the participating resident qualified property taxpaying voters who have duly rendered their
property for taxation.  The maximum rate of tax may be changed at subsequent elections so long
as obligations are not impaired, and not to exceed the maximum limit of Seventy five Cents
(75) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation, and no election shall be required by
subsequent changes in the boundaries of the City of Amarillo.
     If such tax is authorized, no political subdivision or municipality within or having the
same boundaries as the district may levy a tax for medical or hospital care for needy individuals,
nor shall they maintain or erect hospital facilities, but the district shall by resolution assume all
such responsibilities and shall assume all of the liabilities and obligations (including bonds and
warrants) of such subdivisions or municipalities or both.  The maximum tax rate submitted shall
be sufficient to discharge such obligations, liabilities, and responsibilities, and to maintain and
operate the hospital system, and the Legislature may authorize the district to issue tax bonds for
the purpose of the purchase, construction, acquisition, repair or renovation of improvements and
initially equipping the same, and such bonds shall be payable from said Seventy five Cents (75)
tax.  The Legislature shall provide for transfer of title to properties to the district.
     (b) The Legislature may by law permit the County of Potter (in which the City of
Amarillo is partially located) to render financial aid to that district by paying a part of the
expenses of operating and maintaining the system and paying a part of the debts of the district
(whether assumed or created by the district) and may authorize the levy of a tax not to exceed
Ten Cents (10) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation (in addition to other taxes
permitted by this Constitution) upon all property within the county but without the City of
Amarillo at the time such levy is made for such purposes.  If such tax is authorized, the district
shall by resolution assume the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities of the county in the
manner and to the extent hereinabove provided for political subdivisions having boundaries
coextensive with the district, and the county shall not thereafter levy taxes (other than herein
provided) for hospital purposes nor for providing hospital care for needy individuals of the
county.
     (c) The Legislature may by law authorize the creation of a hospital district within
Jefferson County, the boundaries of which shall include only the area comprising the Jefferson
County Drainage District No. 7 and the Port Arthur Independent School District, as such
boundaries existed on the first day of January, 1957, with the power to issue bonds for the sole
purpose of purchasing a site for, and the construction and initial equipping of, a hospital system,
and with the power to levy a tax of not to exceed Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) valuation of property therein for the purpose of paying the principal and
interest on such bonds.
     The creation of such hospital district shall not be final until approved at an election by a
majority of the resident property taxpaying voters voting at shall election who have duly rendered
their property for taxation upon the tax rolls of either said Drainage or said School District, nor
shall such bonds be issued or such tax be levied until so approved by such voters.
     The district shall not have the power to levy any tax for maintenance or operation of the
hospital or facilities, but shall contract with other political subdivisions of the state or private
individuals, associations, or corporations for such purposes.
     If the district hereinabove authorized is finally created, no other hospital district may be
created embracing any part of the territory within its boundaries, but the Legislature by law may

respectively, and all subsequent appointments to be according to the provisions of this section. 
One such appointive member shall be well versed in veterans' affairs and the other such
appointive member shall be well versed in finances.  The Commissioner of the General Land
Office shall act as Chairman of the Board and shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land
Program under such terms and restrictions as may be provided by law.  The compensation for
said appointive members shall be as fixed by the Legislature, and shall make bond in such
amount as may be prescribed by the Legislature.  The Veterans' Land Board may issue not to
exceed Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) in bonds or obligations of the State of
Texas for the purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund.  Such bonds

denominations, and upon the terms as are now prescribed by law or as  may be hereafter be
provided by law; provided, however, that said bonds shall bear a rate of interest not to exceed
three per cent (3%) per annum, and that the same shall be sold for not less than par value and
accrued interest.
     In the sale of any such bonds, a preferential right of purchase shall be given to the
administrators of the various Teacher Retirement Funds, the Permanent University Funds, and
the Permanent School Funds; such bonds to be issued as needed in the opinion of the Veterans'
Land Board.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used for the sole purpose of purchasing lands suitable
for the purpose hereinafter stated, situated in this State, (a) owned by the United States, or any
governmental agency thereof; (b) owned by the Texas Prison System, or any other governmental
agency of the State of Texas; or (c) owned by any person, firm or corporation.  Provided,
however, the portion of the Veterans' Land Fund not immediately committed for the purchase of
lands may be invested in short term United States bonds or obligations until such funds are
needed for the purchase of lands.  The interest accruing thereon shall become a part of the
Veterans' Land Fund.
     All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in
cash, and shall be a part of the Veterans' Land Fund.
     The lands of the Veteran's Land Fund shall be sold by the State of Texas veterans of the
present war or wars, commonly known as World War II, and to Texas veterans of service in the
armed forces of the United States of America subsequent to 1945, as may be included within this

the sale of the lands and interest on deferred payments, or so much thereof as may be necessary,
shall be set aside for the retirement of bonds heretofore issued and to pay interest thereon, and
any of such monies not so needed shall not later than the maturity date of the last maturing bond
or bonds be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund to be appropriated to such
purposes as may be hereafter prescribed by law.  All bonds issued hereunder shall, after approval
by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the Comptroller of the State of Texas, and
delivery to the purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute obligations of the State under the
Constitution of Texas.  Of the total Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) of bonds
herein authorized, the sum of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) has heretofore been
issued; said bonds heretofore issued are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be
obligations of the State of Texas.

     The additional bonds herein authorized may be sold in such installments as deemed
necessary and advisable by the Veterans' Land Board.  All monies received from the sale of land
and for interest on deferred payments on land purchased with the proceeds of such additional
bonds, shall be credited to the Veterans' Land Fund for use in purchasing additional lands to be
sold to Texas veterans, as herein provided, in like manner as provided for the sale of lands
purchased with the proceeds from the sales of the bonds provided for herein, for a period ending
December 1, 1965; provided, however, that so much of such monies as may be necessary to pay

retirement of such additional bonds and to pay interest thereon, and any of such monies not so
needed shall not later than the maturity date of the last maturing bond be deposited to the credit

herein authorized, the sum of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) has heretofore been
issued; said bonds heretofore issued are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be

Section 49-d.  It is hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Texas to encourage the
optimum development of the limited number of feasible sites available for the construction or
enlargement of dams and reservoirs for conservation of the public waters of the State, which
waters are held in trust for the use and benefit of the public.  To this end, and with the approval
of Board of Water Engineers or its successors, the proceeds of State bonds deposited in the Texas
Water Development Fund as provided in Article III, Section 49-c of this Constitution, may be
used by the Texas Water Development Board, under such provisions as the Legislature may
prescribe by general law, for the additional purposes of acquiring and developing storage
facilities for the conservation and development of water for useful purposes in and from
reservoirs constructed or to be constructed or enlarged within the State of Texas or on any stream
constituting a boundary of the State of Texas, by any one or more of the following governments
or governmental agencies: by the United States of America or any agency, department or
instrumentality thereof; by the State of Texas or any agency, department or instrumentality
thereof; by political subdivisions or bodies politic and corporate of the State; by interstate
compact commissions to which the State of Texas is a party; and by municipal corporations.
     Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law, the Texas Water
Development Board may also, with the approval of the Board of Water Engineers of its
successor, execute long-term contracts with the United States or any of its agencies for the
acquisition and development of storage facilities in reservoirs constructed or to be constructed by
the Federal Government.  Such contacts when executed shall constitute general obligations of the
State of Texas in the same manner and with the same effect as state bonds issued under the
authority of the preceding Section 49-c of this Constitution, and the provisions in said Section
49-c with respect to payment of principal and interest on state bonds issued shall likewise apply
with respect to payment of principal and interest required to be paid by said contracts.  If storage
facilities are required for a term of years, such contracts shall contain provisions for renewal that
will protect the state's investment.
     The aggregate of the bonds authorized by said Section 49-c, plus the principal of the
obligations incurred under any contracts authorized hereunder, shall not exceed Two Hundred
Million Dollars ($200,000,000) in bonds authorized by said Section 49-c of Article III of the
Constitution. 
     The Legislature shall provide terms and conditions for the Texas Water Development
Board to sell, transfer or lease, in whole or in part, any acquired facilities or the right to use such
facilities at a price not less than the direct cost of the Board in acquiring the same; and the
Legislature may provide terms and conditions for the Board to sell any unappropriated waters of
the state that might be stored at such facilities.  As a prerequisite to the purchase of such storage
or water, the applicant therefor shall have secured a valid permit from the Board of Water
Engineers or its successor authorizing the acquisition of such storage facilities or the water
impounded therein.  The money received from any sale, transfer or lease of storage facilities shall
be used to pay principal and interest on state bonds issued or contractual obligations incurred by
the Texas Water Development Board, provided that when moneys are sufficient to pay the full
amount of indebtedness then outstanding and the full amount of interest to accrue thereon, any
further sums received from the sale, transfer or lease of such storage facilities may be used for
the acquisition of additional storage facilities or for providing financial assistance as authorized
by said Section 49-c.  Money received from the sale of water, which shall include standby
service, may be used for the operation and maintenance of acquired facilities, and for payment of
principal and interest on debt incurred.
     Should the Legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of this Amendment, such acts
shall not be void by reason of their anticipatory character.

Sec. 48-b.  TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM.  There is hereby created as an agency of the
State of Texas the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, the rights of membership in which, the
retirement privileges and benefits hereunder, and the management and operations of which shall
be governed by the provisions herein contained and by present or hereafter enacted Acts of the
Legislature not inconsistent herewith.  The general administration and responsibility for the
proper operation of said system are hereby vested in a State Board of Trustees, to be known as
the State Board of Trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which Board shall be
constituted and shall serve as may now or hereafter be provided by the Legislature.  Said Board
shall exercise such powers as are herein provided together with such other powers and duties not
inconsistent herewith as may be prescribed by the Legislature.  All moneys from whatever source
coming into the fund to provide retirement, disability and death benefits for persons employed in
the public schools, colleges, and universities supported wholly or partly by the state and all other
securities, moneys and assets of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall be administered
by said Board and said Board shall be the trustees thereof.  The Treasurer of the State of Texas
shall be custodian of said moneys and securities.  Said Board is hereby authorized and
empowered to acquire, hold, manage, purchase, sell, assign, trade, transfer and dispose of any
securities, evidences of debt, and other investments in which said securities, moneys, and assets
have been or may hereafter be invested by said Board.  Said Board is hereby authorized and
empowered to invest and reinvest any of said securities, moneys, and assets, as well as the
proceeds of any of such investments, in bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness issued
or assumed or guaranteed in whole or in part, by the United States or any agency of the United
States, or by the State of Texas, or by any county, city, school district, municipal corporation, or
other political subdivision of the State of Texas, both general and special obligations; or in home
office facilities to be used in administering the Teacher Retirement System including land,
equipment and office building; or in such corporation bonds, notes, other evidences of
indebtedness, and corporation stocks, including common and preferred stocks of any corporation
created or existing under the laws of the United States, as said Board may deem to be proper
investments;  provided that in making each and all of such investments said Board shall exercise
the judgement and care under the circumstances then prevailing which men of ordinary prudence,
discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to
speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income therefrom as well as probable safety of their capital; and further provided, that a
sufficient sum shall be kept on hand to meet payments as they become due each year under such
retirement plan, as may now or hereafter be provided by law.  Unless investments authorized
herein are hereafter further restricted by an Act of the Legislature, no more than one per cent
(1%) of the book value of the total assets of the Teacher Retirement System shall be invested in
the stock of any one (1) corporation, nor shall more than five per cent (5%) of the voting stock of
any one (1) corporation be owned; and provided further, that stocks eligible for purchase shall be
restricted to stocks of companies incorporated with the United States which have paid cash
dividends for ten (10) consecutive years or longer immediately prior to the date of purchase and
which, except for bank stocks and insurance stocks, are listed upon an exchange registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or its successors; and provided, further, that so long as
less than $500,000,000 of said fund is invested in the government and municipal securities
enumerated above, not more than thirty-three and one-third per cent (33 1/3%) of the fund shall
be invested at an given time in common stocks.  This Amendment shall be self-enacting and shall
become effective immediately upon its adoption without any enabling legislation.  This section
shall not alter, amend or repeal the first paragraph of Section 48-a of Article III of the
Constitution of Texas as amended Nov. 6, 1956, or any legislation passed pursuant thereto.  This
section shall not alter, amend or repeal the second paragraph of Section 48-a of Article III of the
Constitution of Texas as amended Nov. 6, 1956, or any legislation passed pursuant thereto,
except insofar as the provisions of the second paragraph of Section 48-a and any legislation
passed pursuant thereto, may limit or restrict the provisions hereof and only to the extent of such
limitation or restriction.

provide for, issue and sell general obligation bonds of the State of Texas in an amount not to
exceed Eighty-five Million Dollars ($85,000,000).  The bonds authorized herein shall be called
"Texas College Student Loan Bonds," shall be executed in such form, denominations and upon

to make loans to students who have been admitted to attend any institution of higher education
within the State of Texas, public of private, including Junior Colleges, which are recognized or
accredited under terms and conditions prescribed by the Legislature, and to pay interest and
principal on such bonds and provide a sinking fund therefor under such conditions as the
Legislature.
     (c) While any of the bonds, or interest on said bonds authorized by this Section is
outstanding and unpaid, there is hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the
Treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount sufficient
to pay the principal and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such fiscal year,
less the amount in the sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year.
     (d) The Legislature may provide for the investment of moneys available in the Texas
Opportunity Plan Fund, and the interest and sinking funds established for the payment of bonds
issued by the Coordinating Board, Texas College and University System, or its successor or
successors.  Income from such investment shall be used for the purposes prescribed by the
Legislature.
     (e) All bonds issued hereunder shall, after approval by the Attorney General, registration
by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchasers, be
incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of Texas under this
Constitution.

Sec. 1 a.  RETIREMENT, CENSURE, REMOVAL, AND COMPENSATION OF JUSTICES
AND JUDGES; STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT; PROCEDURE.  (1)
Subject to the further provisions of this Section, the Legislature shall provide for the retirement
and compensation of Justices and Judges of the Appellate Courts and District and Criminal
District Courts on account of length of service, age and disability, and for their reassignment to
active duty where and when needed.  The office of every such Justice and Judge shall become
vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy five (75) years or such earlier age, not less
than seventy (70) years, as the Legislature may prescribe; but in the case of an incumbent whose
term of office includes the effective date of this Amendment, this provision shall not prevent him
from serving the remainder of said term nor be applicable to him before his period or periods of
judicial service shall have reached a total of ten (10) years.
     (2) There is hereby created the State Judicial Qualifications Commission, to consist of
nine (9) members, to wit:  (i)  two (2) Justices of  Courts of Civil Appeals; (ii) two (2) District
Judges; (iii)  two (2) members of the State Bar, who have respectively practiced as such for over
ten (10) consecutive years next preceding their selection; (iiii) three (3) citizens, at least thirty
(30) years of age, not licensed to practice law nor holding any salaried public office or
employment; provided that no person shall be or remain a member of the Commission who does
not maintain a physical residence within this State, or who resides in, or holds a judgeship within
or for, the same Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission, or who shall
have ceased to retain the qualifications above specified for his respective class of membership.
     (3) The regular term of office of Commissioners shall be six (6) years; but the initial
members of each of classes (i), (ii) and (iii) shall respectively be chosen for terms of four (4) and
six (6) years, and the initial members of class (iiii) for respective terms of two (2), four (4) and
six (6) years.  Interim vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as vacancies due to expiration
of a full term, but only for the unexpired portion of the term in question.  Commissioners may
succeed themselves in office only if having served less than three (3) consecutive years.
     (4) Commissioners shall receive no compensation for their services as such.  The
Legislature shall provide for the payment of the necessary expense for the operation of the
Commission.
     (5) The Commission may hold its meetings, hearings and other proceedings at such times
and places as it shall determine but shall meet at Austin at least once each year.  It shall annually
select one of its members as Chairman.  A quorum shall consist of five (5) members. 
Proceedings shall be by majority vote of those present, except that recommendations for
retirement, or removal of Justices of Judges shall be by affirmative vote of at least six (6)
members.
     (6)Any Justice or Judge within the scope of this Section 1-a may, subject to the other
provisions hereof, be removed from office for willful or persistent conduct, which is clearly
inconsistent with the proper performance of his said duties or casts public discredit upon the
judiciary or administration of justice; or any such Judge or Justice may be involuntarily retired
for disability seriously interfering with the performance of his duties, which is, or is likely to
become, permanent in nature.
     (7) The Commission shall keep itself informed as fully as may be of circumstances
relating to the misconduct or disability of particular Justices or Judges, receive complaints or
reports, formal or informal, from any source in this behalf and make such preliminary
investigations as it may determine.  Its orders for the attendance or testimony of witnesses or for
the production of documents at any hearing or investigation shall be enforceable by contempt
proceedings in the District Court.
     (8) The Commission may, after such investigation as it deems necessary, order a hearing
to be held before it concerning the removal or retirement of a Justice or Judge, or it may in its
discretion request the Supreme Court to appoint an active or retired District Judge or Justice of a
Court of Civil Appeals as a Master to hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report
thereon to the Commission.  If, after considering the record and report of a Master, the
Commission finds good cause therefore, it shall recommend to the Supreme Court the removal or
retirement, as the case may be, of the Justice or Judge in question and shall thereupon file with
the Clerk of the Supreme Court the entire  record before the Commission.
     (9) The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts
and in its discretion may, for good cause shown, permit the introduction of additional evidence
and shall order public removal or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the
recommendation.  Upon an order for involuntary retirement for disability or an order for removal,
the office in question shall become vacant.  The rights of an incumbent so retired to retirement
benefits shall be the same as if his retirement had been voluntary.
     (10) All papers filed with and proceedings before the Commission, Master or the
Supreme Court shall be privileged, provided that upon being filed in the Supreme Court the
record loses its confidential character; and the filing of papers with, and the giving of testimony
before the Commission or a Master shall be privileged. 
     (11) The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, and the Supreme Court.  Such rule shall afford to any judge, against whom a proceeding
is instituted to cause his retirement, due process of law for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, and the Supreme Court in the same manner that any person whose property rights are in
jeopardy in an adjudicatory proceeding is entitled to due process of law, regardless of whether or
not the interest of the judge in remaining in active status is considered to be a right or a privilege. 
Due process shall include the right to notice, counsel, hearing, confrontation of his accusers, and
all such other incidents of due process as are ordinarily available in proceedings whether or not
misfeasance is charged, upon proof of which a penalty may be imposed.
     (12) No Justice or Judge shall sit as a member of the Commission in any proceeding
involving his own retirement or removal. 
     (13) This Section 1 a is alternative to and cumulative of, the methods of removal of
Justices or Judges provided elsewhere in this Constitution.

constructing and initially equipping buildings or other permanent improvements at the designated
institutions of higher learning provided that none of the proceeds of this tax shall be used for
auxiliary enterprises; and the governing board of each such institution of higher learning is fully
authorized to pledge all or any part of said funds allotted to such institution as hereinafter
provided, to secure bonds or notes issued for the purpose of acquiring, constructing and initially
equipping such buildings or other permanent improvements at said respective institutions.  Such
bonds or notes shall be issued in such amounts as may be determined by the governing boards of
said respective institutions, shall bear interest not to exceed four per cent (4%) per annum and
shall mature serially or otherwise in not more than ten (10) years; provided further, that the state
tax on property as heretofore permitted to be levied by Section 9 of Article VIII, as amended,
exclusive of the tax necessary to pay the public debt, and of taxes provided for the benefit of the

                    (2) Ten per cent (10%) of the funds allocated on June 1, 1966, shall be allocated
          to certain of the eligible State institutions based on the number of additional
          square feet needed in educational and general facilities by such eligible State
          institution to meet the average square feet per full-time equivalent student of all
          State senior institutions (currently numbering twenty-two).
                    (3) All of the funds allocated on June 1, 1972, shall be allocated to certain of the
          eligible State institutions based on determinations used in the June 1, 1966,
          allocations, except that the allocation of fifty per cent (50%) of the funds allocated
          on June 1, 1972, shall be based on projected enrollment increases for fall 1972 to
          fall 1978, and fifty per cent (50%) of such funds allocated on June 1, 1972, shall
          be based on the need for additional square feet of educational and general
          facilities.
     Not later than June first of the beginning year of each succeeding ten-year period, the
Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas shall reallocate eighty-five per cent (85%)
of the funds to be derived from said Ten Cent (10) ad valorem tax for said ten-year period and
not later than June first of the sixth year of each succeeding ten-year period said Comptroller
shall reallocate fifteen per cent (15%) of such funds to the eligible State institutions then in
existence based on determinations for the said ten-year period similar to the determinations used
in allocating funds during the twelve-year period beginning Jan. 1, 1966, except that enrollment
projections for succeeding ten-year periods will be from the fall semester of the first year to the
fall semester of the tenth year.  All such designated institutions of higher learning shall not
thereafter receive any general revenue funds for the acquiring or constructing of buildings or
other permanent improvements for which said Ten Cent (10) ad valorem tax is herein provided,
except in case of fire, flood, storm, or earthquake occurring at any such institution, in which case
an appropriation in an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss so incurred may be made
by the Legislature out of any General Revenue Funds.  The State Comptroller of Public Accounts
shall draw all necessary and proper warrants upon the State Treasury in order to carry out the
purpose of this amendment, and the State Treasurer shall pay warrants so issued out of the
special fund hereby created for said purpose.  This amendment shall be self-enacting.  It shall
become operative or effective upon its adoption so as to supersede or repeal the former
provisions of this Section; provided further, that nothing herein shall be so construed as
impairing the obligation incurred by any outstanding notes or bonds heretofore issued by any
state institution of higher learning under this Section prior to the adoption of this amendment but
such notes or bonds shall be paid, both as to principal and interest, from the fund as allocated to

purposes by construction or reconstruction or enlargement of reservoirs constructed or to be
constructed or enlarged within the State of Texas or on any stream constituting a boundary of the
State of Texas, together with any system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment and/or
transportation of water, by any one or more of the following governmental agencies: by the
United States of America or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by the State of
Texas or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by the political subdivisions or
bodies politic and corporate of the state; by interstate compact commissions of which the State of
Texas is a party; and by municipal corporations.  The Legislature shall provide terms and
conditions under which the Texas Water Development Board may sell, transfer or lease, in whole
or in part, any reservoir and associated system or works which the Texas Water Development
Board has financed in whole or in part.
     Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law, the Texas Water
Development Board may also, with the approval of the Board of Water Engineers of its
successor, execute long-term contracts with the United States or any of its agencies for the
acquisition and development of storage facilities in reservoirs constructed or to be constructed by
the Federal Government.  Such contacts when executed shall constitute general obligations of the
State of Texas in the same manner and with the same effect as state bonds issued under the
authority of the preceding Section 49-c of this Constitution, and the provisions in said Section
49-c with respect to payment of principal and interest on state bonds issued shall likewise apply
with respect to payment of principal and interest required to be paid by said contracts.  If storage
facilities are required for a term of years, such contracts shall contain provisions for renewal that
will protect the state's investment.
     The aggregate of the bonds authorized hereunder shall not exceed $200,000,000 and shall
be in addition to the aggregate of the bonds previously authorized by said Section 49-c of Article
III of the Constitution.  The Legislature upon two-thirds (2/3) vote of the elected members of
each House, may authorize the Board to issue all or any portion of such $200,000,000 in
additional bonds herein authorized.
     The Legislature shall provide terms and conditions for the Texas Water Development
Board to sell, transfer or lease, in whole or in part, any acquired facilities or the right to use such
facilities together with any associated system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment or
transportation of water at a price not less than the direct cost of the Board in acquiring the same;
and the Legislature may provide terms and conditions for the Board to sell any unappropriated
waters of the state that might be stored at such facilities.  As a prerequisite to the purchase of
such storage or water, the applicant therefor shall have secured a valid permit from the Texas
Water Commission or its successor authorizing the acquisition of such storage facilities or the
water impounded therein.  The money received from any sale, transfer or lease of storage
facilities or associated systems or works shall be used to pay principal and interest on state bonds
issued or contractual obligations incurred by the Texas Water Development Board, provided that
when moneys are sufficient to pay the full amount of indebtedness then outstanding and the full
amount of interest to accrue thereon, any further sums received from the sale, transfer or lease of
such storage facilities or associated system or works may be used for the acquisition of additional
storage facilities or associated system or works or for providing financial assistance as authorized
by said Section 49-c.  Money received from the sale of water, which shall include standby
service, may be used for the operation and maintenance of acquired facilities, and for payment of
principal and interest on debt incurred.
     Should the Legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of this Amendment, such acts
shall not be void by reason of their anticipatory character.

improvements and equipment located wholly within the district which may be jointly or
separately owned by any city, town or county, providing that any district so created shall assume
full responsibility for providing medical and hospital care for its needy inhabitants and assume
the outstanding indebtedness incurred by cities, towns and counties for hospital purposes prior to
the creation of the district, if same are located wholly within its boundaries, and a pro rata portion
of such indebtedness based upon the then last approved tax assessment rolls of the included
cities, towns and counties is less than all the territory thereof is included within the district
boundaries; providing that after its creation no other municipality or political subdivision shall

providing further that the support and maintenance of the district's hospital system shall never
become a charge against or obligation of the State of Texas nor shall any direct appropriation be

counties, with power to issue general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, either or both of them, for
the purchase, acquisition by the exercise of the power of eminent domain or otherwise,
construction, reconstruction, repair or renovation of any airport or airports, landing fields and
runways, airport buildings, hangars, facilities, equipment, fixtures, and any and all property, real
or personal, necessary to operate, equip and maintain an airport.
     The Legislature shall provide for the option by the governing body of the city or cities
whose airport facilities are served by certificated airlines and whose facility or some interest
therein, is proposed to be or has been acquired by the Authority, to either appoint or elect a Board
of Directors of said Authority.  If the Directors are appointed such appointment shall be made by
the County Commissioners Court after consultation with and consent of the governing body or
bodies of such city or cities.  If the Board of Directors is elected they shall be elected by the
qualified voters of the county which chooses to elect the Directors to represent that county. 
Directors shall serve without compensation for a term fixed by the Legislature not to exceed six
(6) years, shall be selected on the basis of the proportionate population of each county based
upon the last preceding Federal Census, and shall be residents of such county.  No county shall
have less than one (1) member on the Board of Directors.
     The Legislature shall provide for the holding of an election in each county proposing the
creation of an Authority to be called by the Commissioners Court or Commissioners Courts, as
the case may be, upon petition of five per cent (5%) of the qualified voters within the county or
counties.  The elections must be held on the same day if more than one county is included.  No
more than one (1) such election may be called in a county until after the expiration of one (1)
year in the event such an election has failed, and thereafter only upon a petition of ten per cent
(10%) of the qualified  voters being presented to the Commissioners Court or Commissioners
Courts of the county or counties in which such an election has failed.  In the event that two or
more counties vote on the proposition of the creation of an Authority therein, the proposition
shall not be deemed to carry unless the majority of the qualified voters in each county voting
thereon vote in favor thereof.  An Airport Authority may be created and be composed of the
county or counties that vote in favor of its creation if separate propositions are submitted to the
voters of each county so that they may vote for a two or more county Authority or a single county
Authority.
     The Legislature shall provide for the appointment by the Board of Directors of an
Assessor and Collector of Taxes in the Authority, whether constituted of one or more counties,
whose duty it shall be to assess all taxable property, both real and personal, and collect the taxes
thereon, based upon the tax rolls approved by the Board of Directors, the tax to be levied not to
exceed Seventy Five Cents ($.75) per One Hundred Dollars ($100) assessed valuation of the
property.  The property of state regulated common carriers required by law to pay a tax upon
intangible assets shall not be subject to taxation by the Authority.  The taxable property shall be
assessed on a valuation not to exceed the market value and shall be equal and uniform throughout
the Authority as is otherwise provided by the Constitution.
     The Legislature shall authorize the purchase or acquisition by the Authority of any
existing airport facility publicly owned and financed and served by certificated airlines, in fee or
of any interest therein, or to enter into any lease agreement therefor, upon such terms and
conditions as may be mutually agreeable to the Authority and the owner of such facilities, or
authorize the acquisition of same through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.  In the
event of such acquisition, if there are any general obligation bonds that the owner of the publicly
owned airport facility has outstanding, the same shall be fully assumed by the Authority and
sufficient taxes levied by the Authority to discharge said outstanding indebtedness.  If any city or
owner has outstanding revenue bonds where the revenues of the airport have been pledged or
said bonds constitute a lien against the airport facilities, the Authority shall assume and discharge
all the obligations of the city under the ordinances and bond indentures under which said revenue
bonds have been issued and sold.
     Any city which owns airport facilities not serving certificated airlines which are not
purchased or acquired or taken over as herein provided by such Authority shall have the power to
operate the same under the existing laws or as the same may hereafter be amended.
     Any such Authority when created may be granted the power and authority to promulgate,
adopt and enforce appropriate zoning regulations to protect the airport from hazards and
obstructions which would interfere with the use of the airport and its facilities for landing and
take off.
     An additional county or counties may be added to an existing Authority if a petition of
five per cent (5%) of the qualified voters is filed with and an election is called by the
Commissioners Court of the county or counties seeking admission to an Authority.  If the vote is
favorable, then admission may be granted to such county or counties by the Board of Directors of
the then existing Authority upon such terms and conditions as they may agree upon and
evidenced by a resolution approved by two thirds (2/3rds) of the then existing Board of Directors. 
The county or counties that may be so added to the then existing Authority shall be given
representation on the Board of Directors by adding additional directors in proportion to their
population according to the last preceding Federal Census.

investments said Board shall exercise the judgement and care under the circumstances then
prevailing which men of ordinary prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the
management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent
disposition of their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as probable safety
of their capital; and further provided, that a sufficient sum shall be kept on hand to meet
payments as they become due each year under such retirement plan, as may now or hereafter be

become effective immediately upon its adoption without any enabling legislation. 
     (b) Each county shall have the right to provide for and administer a Retirement, Disability
and Death Compensation Fund for the appointive officers and employees of the county; provided
the same is authorized by a majority vote of the qualified voters of such county and after such
election has been advertised by being published in at least one newspaper of general circulation

aid from the State of Texas, unless the Fund, the creation of which is provided for herein,
contributed by the county, is released to the State of Texas as a condition of receiving such other
pension.
     (c) The Texas Legislature is authorized to enact appropriate laws to provide for a System
of Retirement, Disability and Death Benefits for all officers and employees of a county or other
political subdivision of the state, or a political subdivision of a county; providing that when the
Texas Legislature has passed the necessary enabling legislation pursuant to the Constitutional
authorization, then the governing body of the county, or other political subdivision of the state, or
political subdivision of a county shall make the determination as to whether a particular county
or other political subdivision of the state, or a political subdivision of the county participates in
this System; providing further that such System shall be operated at the expense of the county or
political subdivision of the state, or a political subdivision of the county electing to participate
therein and the officers and employees covered by the System; and providing that the Legislature
of the State of Texas shall never make an appropriation to pay the costs of this Retirement,
Disability and Death Compensation System.
     The Legislature may provide for a voluntary merger into the System herein authorized by
this Constitutional Amendment of any System of Retirement, Disability and Death
Compensation Benefits which may now exist or that may hereafter be established under
subsection (b) of Section 62 of Article XVI of the Texas Constitution; providing further that the
Texas Legislature in the enabling statute will make the determination as to the amount of money
that will be contributed by the county or other political subdivision of the state, or  political
subdivision of the county to the State-wide System of Retirement, Disability and Death Benefits,
and the Legislature shall further provide that the amount of money contributed by the county or
other political subdivision of the state, or  political subdivision of the county shall equal the
amount paid for the same purpose from the income of each officer and employee covered by this
State-wide System.
     It is further the intention of the Legislature, in submitting this Constitutional Amendment,
that the officers and employees of the county or other political subdivision of the state or 
political subdivision of a county may be included in these systems regardless of whether the
county or other political subdivision of the state or  political subdivision of the county
participates in the Retirement, Disability and Death Benefit System authorized by this
Constitutional Amendment, or whether they participate in a System under the provisions of
subsection (b) of Section 62 of Article XVI of the Texas Constitution as the same as herein

Sec. 1 d.  ASSESSMENT OF LANDS DESIGNATED FOR AGRICULTURAL USE.  (a) All
land owned by natural persons which is designated for agricultural use in accordance with the
provisions of this Section shall be assessed for all tax purposes on the consideration of only those
factors relative to such agricultural use.  "Agricultural use" means the raising of livestock or
growing of crops, fruit, flowers, and other products of the soil under natural conditions as a
business venture for profit, which business is the primary occupation and source of income of the
owner.
(b) For each assessment year the owner wishes to qualify his land under provisions of this
Section as designated for agricultural use he shall file with the local tax assessor a sworn
statement in writing describing the use to which the land is devoted.
(c) Upon receipt of the sworn statement in writing the local tax assessor shall determine whether
or not such land qualifies for the designation as to agricultural use as defined herein and in the
event it so qualifies he shall designate such land as being for agricultural use and assess the land
accordingly.
(d) Such local tax assessor may inspect the land and require such evidence of use and source of
income as may be necessary or useful in determining whether or not the agricultural use
provision of this article applies.
(e) No land may qualify for the designation provided for in this Act unless for at least three (3)
successive years immediately preceding the assessment date the land has been devoted
exclusively for agricultural use, or unless the land has been continuously developed for
agriculture during such time.
(f) Each year during which the land is designated for agricultural use, the local tax assessor shall
note on his records the valuation which would have been made had the land not qualified for
such designation under this Section.  If designated land is subsequently diverted to a purpose
other than that of agricultural use, or is sold, the land shall be subject to an additional tax.  The
additional tax shall equal the difference between taxes paid or payable, hereunder, and the
amount of tax payable for the preceding three years had the land been otherwise assessed.  Until
paid there shall be a lien for additional taxes and interest on land assessed under the provisions of
this Section.
(g) The valuation and assessment of any minerals or subsurface rights to minerals shall not come
within the provisions of this Section.

expenditures of all public money shall be published annually, in such manner as shall be
prescribed by law.
     (b) State agencies charged with the responsibility of providing services to those who are
blind, crippled, or otherwise physically or mentally handicapped may accept money from private
or federal sources, designated by the private or federal source as money to be used in and
establishing and equipping facilities for assisting those who are blind, crippled, or otherwise
physically or mentally handicapped in becoming gainfully employed, in rehabilitating and
restoring the handicapped, and in providing other services determined by the state agency to be
essential for the better care and treatment of the handicapped. Money accepted under this
subsection is state money. State agencies may spend money accepted under this subsection, and
no other money, for specific programs and projects to be conducted by local level or other
private, nonsectarian associations, groups, and nonprofit organizations, in establishing and
equipping facilities for assisting those who are blind, crippled, or otherwise physically or
mentally handicapped in becoming gainfully employed, in rehabilitating and restoring the
handicapped, and in providing other services determined by the state agency to be essential for
the better care or treatment of the handicapped. The state agencies may deposit money accepted
under this subsection either in the state treasury or in other secure depositories. The money may
not be expended for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was given. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Constitution, the state agencies may expend money accepted under
this subsection without the necessity of an appropriation, unless the Legislature, by law, requires
that the money be expended only on appropriation. The Legislature may prohibit state agencies
from accepting money under this subsection or may regulate the amount of money accepted, the
way the acceptance and expenditure of the money is administered, and the purposes for which the
state agencies may expend the money. Money accepted under this subsection for a purpose
prohibited by the Legislature shall be returned to the entity that gave the money. This subsection
does not prohibit state agencies authorized to render services to the handicapped from contracting
with privately-owned or local facilities for necessary and essential services, subject to such
conditions, standards, and procedures as may be prescribed by law.

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years, but the members serving on said Board on the date
of adoption hereof shall complete the terms to which they were appointed.  In the event of the
resignation or death of any such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to
serve for the unexpired portion of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been
appointed.  The compensation for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be
foxed by the Legislature; and each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be
prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Four Hundred
Million Dollars ($400,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the purpose
of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Two Hundred Million Dollars
($200,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations shall be
sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed four and one-half percent (4%).  All bonds or obligations issued and sold hereunder
shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by
the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or
purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of Texas under
the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board are hereby in
all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas.  In order to
prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the Legislature shall
appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in
bonds or obligations of the United States until such funds are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans who served not less than ninety (90)
continuous days, unless sooner discharged by reason of a service-connected disability, on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard or Marine Corps of the United States after
September 16, 1940 and the date of formal withdrawal of United States troops from the present
armed conflict in Viet Nam, and who, upon the date of filing his or her application to purchase
any land is a citizen of the United States, is a bona fide resident of the State of Texas, and has not
been dishonorably discharged from any branch of the Armed Forces above-named and who at the
time of his or her enlistment, induction, commissioning, or drafting, was a bona fide resident of
the State of Texas, or who has resided in Texas at least five (5) years prior to the date of filing his
or her application.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands the Veterans' Land Fund which
have been first offered for sale to veterans and which have not been sold may be sold or resold to
such purchasers, in such quantities, on such terms, at such prices and  rates of interest, and under
such rules and regulations as are now or may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such
additional bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal
due or to become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds, provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessaries to pay interest o
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided
herein in accordance with the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance and sale of such
additional bonds, until there are sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds hereafter issued and
sold, at which time all such moneys then remaining a part of said Veterans' Land Fund and
thereafter becoming a part of said Fund shall be governed as elsewhere provided herein.
     This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Land Program, there is hereby reposed in the
Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this Amendment,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the
Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

Million Dollars ($75,000,000).  The bonds authorized herein shall be called "Texas Park
Development Bonds," shall be executed in such form, denominations, and upon such terms as

exceed four and one-half percent (4 %) interest per annum; they may be issued in such
installments as said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its successor, finds feasible and practical
in accomplishing the purpose set forth herein.
     All moneys received from the sale of said bonds shall be deposited in a fund hereby
created with the State Treasurer to be known as the Texas Park Development Fund to be
administered (without further appropriation) by the said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its
said successor, in such manner as prescribed by law.
     Such fund shall be used by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor,

acquiring lands from the United States, or any governmental agency thereof, from any
governmental agency of the State of Texas, or from any person, firm, or corporation, for State
Park Sites and for developing said sites as State Parks.

there is hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the Treasury in each fiscal year,
not otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay the
principal and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such fiscal year, less the
amount in the interest and sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year, which includes any
receipts derived during the prior fiscal year by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said
successor, from admission charges to State Parks, as the Legislature may prescribe by general
law.
     The Legislature may provide for the investment of moneys available in the Texas Park
Development Fund and the interest and sinking fund established for the payment of bonds issued

be used for the purposes prescribed by the Legislature.
     From the moneys received by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor,
from the sale of the bonds issued hereunder, there shall be deposited in the interest and sinking
fund for the bonds authorized by this section sufficient moneys to pay the interest to become due
during the State fiscal year in which the bonds were issued.  After all bonds have been fully paid
with interest, or after there are on deposit in the interest and sinking fund sufficient moneys to
pay all future maturities of principal and interest, additional moneys received from admission
charges to State Parks shall be deposited to the State Parks Fund, or any successor fund which
may be established by the Legislature as a depository for Park revenue earned by said Parks and
Wildlife Department, or its said successor.
     All bonds issued hereunder shall after approval by the Attorney General, registration by
the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchasers, be

or Representative shall, during the term for which he was elected, be eligible to (1) any civil
office of profit under this State which shall have been created, or the emoluments of which may
have been increased, during such term, or (2) any office or place, the appointment to which may

vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy five (75) years or such earlier age, not less
than seventy (70) years, as the Legislature may prescribe; but in the case of an incumbent whose
term of office includes the effective date of this Amendment, this provision shall not prevent him
from serving the remainder of said term nor be applicable to him before his period or periods of
judicial service shall have reached a total of ten (10) years.
     (2) There is hereby created the State Judicial Qualifications Commission, to consist of

or for, the same Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission, or who shall
have ceased to retain the qualifications above specified for his respective class of membership.
     (3) The regular term of office of Commissioners shall be six (6) years; but the initial
members of each of classes (i), (ii) and (iii) shall respectively be chosen for terms of four (4) and
six (6) years, and the initial members of class (iiii) for respective terms of two (2), four (4) and

of a full term, but only for the unexpired portion of the term in question.  Commissioners may
succeed themselves in office only if having served less than three (3) consecutive years.
     (4) Commissioners shall receive no compensation for their services as such.  The
Legislature shall provide for the payment of the necessary expense for the operation of the
Commission.
     (5) The Commission may hold its meetings, hearings and other proceedings at such times
and places as it shall determine but shall meet at Austin at least once each year.  It shall annually

          Domestic Relations, a Juvenile Court, a Probate Court, or a Corporation or
          Municipal Court, and any Judge or presiding officer of any special court created
          by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution, may,
          subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for willful or
          persistent conduct, which is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of
          his said duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or administration of
          justice; or any person holding such office may be censured, in lieu of removal
          from office, under procedures provided for by the Legislature. 
                    B. Any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of this subsection who is
          eligible for retirement benefits under the laws of this state providing for judicial
          retirement may be involuntarily retired, and any person holding an office named in
          that paragraph who is not eligible for retirement benefits under such laws may be
          removed from office, for disability seriously interfering with the performance of
          his duties, which is, or is likely to become, permanent in nature.
     (7) The Commission shall keep itself informed as fully as may be of circumstances
relating to the misconduct or disability of particular persons holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, receive complaints or reports, formal or informal,
from any source in this behalf and make such preliminary investigations as it may determine.  Its
orders for the attendance or testimony of witnesses or for the production of documents at any
hearing or investigation shall be enforceable by contempt proceedings in the District Court.
     (8) After such investigation as it deems necessary, the Commission may in its discretion
issue a private reprimand, or if the Commission determines that the situation merits such action,
it may and order a hearing to be held before it concerning the removal, or retirement of a person
holding an office named in Paragraph A of in Subsection (6) of this Section, or it may in its
discretion request the Supreme Court to appoint an active or retired District Judge or Justice of a
Court of Civil Appeals, as a Master to hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report
thereon to the Commission.  If, after considering the record and report of a Master, the
Commission finds good cause therefor, it shall issue an order of public censure or it shall
recommend to the Supreme Court the removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the person in
question holding an office named in Paragraph A of in Subsection (6) of this Section and shall
thereupon file with the Clerk of the Supreme Court the entire  record before the Commission.
     (9) The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts
and in its discretion may, for good cause shown, permit the introduction of additional evidence
and shall order public censure, retirement or removal, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject
the recommendation.  Upon an order for involuntary retirement for disability or an order for
removal, the office in question shall become vacant.  The rights of an incumbent so retired to
retirement benefits shall be the same as if his retirement had been voluntary.
     (10) All papers filed with and proceedings before the Commission, Master or the
Supreme Court shall be privileged, provided that upon being filed in the Supreme Court the
record loses its confidential character; and the filing of papers with, and the giving of testimony
before the Commission or a Master shall be privileged. 
     (11) The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, and the Supreme Court.  Such rule shall afford to any person holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, against whom a proceeding is instituted to cause
his retirement or removal, due process of law for the procedure before the Commission, Masters,
and the Supreme Court in the same manner that any person whose property rights are in jeopardy
in an adjudicatory proceeding is entitled to due process of law, regardless of whether or not the
interest of the person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section in
remaining in active status is considered to be a right or a privilege.  Due process shall include the
right to notice, counsel, hearing, confrontation of his accusers, and all such other incidents of due
process as are ordinarily available in proceedings whether or not misfeasance is charged, upon
proof of which a penalty may be imposed.
     (12) No person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section
shall sit as a member of the Commission in any proceeding involving his own retirement or
removal.

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years, but the members serving on said Board on the date
of adoption hereof shall complete the terms to which they were appointed.  In the event of the
resignation or death of any such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to
serve for the unexpired portion of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been
appointed.  The compensation for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be
foxed by the Legislature; and each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be
prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Five Hundred
Million Dollars ($500,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the purpose
of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Four Hundred Million Dollars
($400,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations shall be
sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or obligations issued and
sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of
Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board
are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas. 
In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the
Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in
bonds or obligations of the United States until such funds are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans who served not less than ninety (90)
continuous days, unless sooner discharged by reason of a service-connected disability, on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard or Marine Corps of the United States after
September 16, 1940, and who, upon the date of filing his or her application to purchase any land
is a citizen of the United States, is a bona fide resident of the State of Texas, and has not been
dishonorably discharged from any branch of the Armed Forces above-named and who at the time
of his or her enlistment, induction, commissioning, or drafting, was a bona fide resident of the
State of Texas, or who has resided in Texas at least five (5) years prior to the date of filing his or
her application, and provided that in the event of the death of an eligible Texas Veteran after the
veteran has filed with the Board an application and contract of sale to purchase through the Board
the tract selected by him or her and before the purchase has been completed, then the surviving
spouse may complete the transaction.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands the Veterans'
Land Fund which have been first offered for sale to veterans and which have not been sold may
be sold or resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, on such terms, at such prices and  rates of
interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now or may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such
additional bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal
due or to become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds, provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessaries to pay interest o
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided
herein in accordance with the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance and sale of such
additional bonds, until there are sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds hereafter issued and
sold, at which time all such moneys then remaining a part of said Veterans' Land Fund and
thereafter becoming a part of said Fund shall be governed as elsewhere provided herein.
     This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Land Program, there is hereby reposed in the
Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this Amendment,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the
Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

Sec. 67.  STATE AND LOCAL RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.  
     (a) General Provisions.  

                    (1) The legislature may enact general laws establishing systems and programs of
          retirement and related disability and death benefits for public employees and
          officers.  Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles.  The
          assets of a system are held in trust for the benefit of members and may not be
          diverted.
                    (2) A person may not receive benefits from more than one system for the same
          service, but the legislature may provide by law that a person with service covered
          by more than one system or program is entitled to a fractional benefit from each
          system or program based on service rendered under each system or program
          calculated as to amount upon the benefit formula used in that system or program. 
          Transfer of service credit between the Employees Retirement System of Texas
          and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas also may be authorized by law.
                    (3) Each statewide benefit system must have a board of trustees to administer the
          system and to invest the funds of the system in such securities as the board may
          consider prudent investments.  In making investments, a board shall exercise the
          judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of
          ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of
          their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent
          disposition of their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as
          the probable safety of their capital.  The legislature by law may further restrict the
          investment discretion of a board.
                    (4) General laws establishing retirement systems and optional retirement programs
          for public employees and officers in effect at the time of the adoption of this
          section remain in effect, subject to the general powers of the legislature
          established in this subsection.
     (b) State Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall establish by law a Teacher Retirement System of Texas
          to provide benefits for persons employed in the public schools, colleges, and
          universities supported wholly or partly by the state.  Other employees may be
          included under the system by law.
                    (2) The legislature shall establish by law an Employees Retirement System of
          Texas to provide benefits for officers and employees of the state and such state
          compensated officers and employees of appellate courts and judicial districts as
          may be included under the system by law.
                    (3) The amount contributed by a person participating in the Employees Retirement
          System of Texas or the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall be established
          by the legislature but may not be less than six percent of current compensation. 
          The amount contributed by the state may not be less than six percent nor more
          than 10 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to individuals participating in
          the system.  In an emergency, as determined by the governor, the legislature may
          appropriate such additional sums as are actuarially determined to be required to
          fund benefits authorized by law.
     (c) Local Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall provide by law for:
                              (A) the creation by any city or county of a system of benefits for its
               officers and employees;
                              (B) a statewide system of benefits for the officers and employees of
               counties or other political subdivisions of the state in which counties or
               other political subdivisions may voluntarily participate; and
                              (C) a statewide system of benefits for officers and employees of cities in
               which cities may voluntarily participate.
                    (2) Benefits under these systems must be reasonably related to participant tenure
          and contributions.
          (d) Judicial Retirement System.
                     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the system of retirement,
          disability, and survivors' benefits heretofore established in the constitution or by
          law for justices, judges, and commissioners of the appellate courts and judges of
          the district and criminal district courts is continued in effect.  Contributions
          required and benefits payable are to be as provided by law.
                    (2) General administration of the Judicial Retirement System of Texas is by the
          Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas under such
          regulations as may be provided by law.
     (e) Anticipatory Legislation.  Legislation enacted in anticipation of this amendment is not
void because it is anticipatory.

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years, but the members serving on said Board on the date
of adoption hereof shall complete the terms to which they were appointed.  In the event of the
resignation or death of any such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to
serve for the unexpired portion of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been
appointed.  The compensation for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be
foxed by the Legislature; and each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be
prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Seven Hundred
Million Dollars ($700,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the purpose
of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Five Hundred Million Dollars
($500,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations shall be
sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or obligations issued and
sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of
Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board
are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas. 
In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the
Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in
bonds or obligations of the United States until such funds are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans who served not less than ninety (90)
continuous days, unless sooner discharged by reason of a service-connected disability, on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard or Marine Corps of the United States after
September 16, 1940, and who, upon the date of filing his or her application to purchase any land
is a citizen of the United States, is a bona fide resident of the State of Texas, and has not been
dishonorably discharged from any branch of the Armed Forces above-named and who at the time
of his or her enlistment, induction, commissioning, or drafting, was a bona fide resident of the
State of Texas, or who has resided in Texas at least five (5) years prior to the date of filing his or
her application, and provided that in the event of the death of an eligible Texas Veteran after the
veteran has filed with the Board an application and contract of sale to purchase through the Board
the tract selected by him or her and before the purchase has been completed, then the surviving
spouse may complete the transaction.  The unmarried surviving spouses of veterans who died in
the line of duty may also apply to purchase a tract through the Board provided the deceased
veterans meet the requirements set out in this Article with the exception that the deceased
veterans need not have served ninety (90) continuous days and provided further that the deceased
veterans were bona fide residents of the State of Texas at the time of enlistment, induction,
commissioning or drafting.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands the Veterans' Land Fund
which have been first offered for sale to veterans and which have not been sold may be sold or
resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, on such terms, at such prices and  rates of interest,
and under such rules and regulations as are now or may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such
additional bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal
due or to become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds, provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessaries to pay interest o
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided

Subject to the further provisions of this Section, the Legislature shall provide for the retirement
and compensation of Justices and Judges of the Appellate Courts and District and Criminal
District Courts on account of length of service, age and disability, and for their reassignment to
active duty where and when needed.  The office of every such Justice and Judge shall become
vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy five (75) years or such earlier age, not less
than seventy (70) years, as the Legislature may prescribe; but in the case of an incumbent whose
term of office includes the effective date of this Amendment, this provision shall not prevent him
from serving the remainder of said term nor be applicable to him before his period or periods of
judicial service shall have reached a total of ten (10) years.
     (2) The name of the State Judicial Qualifications Commission is changed to the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct.  The Commission consists of eleven (11) members, to wit:  (i) 
two (2) Justices of  Courts of Civil Appeals; (ii) two (2) District Judges; (iii)  two (2) members of
the State Bar, who have respectively practiced as such for over ten (10) consecutive years next

practice law nor holding any salaried public office or employment; and (v) one (1) Justice of the
Peace; provided that no person shall be or remain a member of the Commission, who does not
maintain physical residence within this State, or who resides in, or holds a judgeship within or
for, the same Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission, or who shall have
ceased to retain the qualifications above specified for his respective class of membership, except
that the Justice of the Peace and the Judges of a Municipal Court and or a County Court at Law
shall be selected at large without regard to whether they reside or hold a judgeship in the same
Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission.  Commissioners of classes (i)
and (ii) above shall be chosen by the Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate, those
of class (iii) by the Board of Directors of the State Bar under regulations to be prescribed by the
Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate, those of class (iiii) by appointment of the
Governor with advice and consent of the Senate, and the commissioner of class (v) by
appointment of the Supreme Court from a list of five (5) names submitted by the executive
committee of the Justice of the Peace and Constables Association of Texas, with the advice and
consent of the Senate.  The initial term of the commissioner of class (v) and the fourth
commissioner of class (iiii) added by this amendment terminates on November 19, 1979.  Each
person holding office as a member of the Commission on the effective date of this amendment
continues to hold office for the term for which he was appointed.
     (3) The regular term of office of Commissioners shall be six (6) years; but the initial
members of each of classes (i), (ii) and (iii) shall respectively be chosen for terms of four (4) and
six (6) years, and the initial members of class (iiii) for respective terms of two (2), four (4) and
six (6) years.  Interim vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as vacancies due to expiration
of a full term, but only for the unexpired portion of the term in question.  Commissioners may
succeed themselves in office only if having served less than three (3) consecutive years.
     (4) Commissioners shall receive no compensation for their services as such.  The
Legislature shall provide for the payment of the necessary expense for the operation of the
Commission.
     (5) The Commission may hold its meetings, hearings and other proceedings at such times
and places as it shall determine but shall meet at Austin at least once each year.  It shall annually
select one of its members as Chairman.  A quorum shall consist of six (6) members.  Proceedings
shall be by majority vote of those present, except that recommendations for retirement, censure,
suspension, or removal of any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6)
of this Section shall be by affirmative vote of at least six (6) members.
               (6)  A. Any Justice or Judge of the Appellate Courts and District and Criminal District
          Courts, and any County Judge, and any Judge of a County Court at law, a Court of
          Domestic Relations, a Juvenile Court, a Probate Court, or a Corporation or
          Municipal Court, and any Justice of the Peace, and any Judge or presiding officer
          of any special court created by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V,
          of this Constitution, may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from
          office for willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper
          performance of his said duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or
          administration of justice, or any person holding such office may be censured, in
          lieu of removal from office, under procedures provided for by the Legislature. 
          Any person holding an office named in this subsection may be suspended from
          office with or without pay by the Commission immediately on being indicted by a
          State or Federal grand jury for a felony offense or, on the filing of a sworn
          complaint charging a person holding such office with willful and persistent
          conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or
          casts public discredit on the judiciary or on the administration of justice, the
          Commission, after giving the person notice and an opportunity to appear and be
          heard before the Commission, may recommend to the Supreme Court the
          suspension of such person from office.  The Supreme Court, after considering the
          record of such appearance and the recommendation of the Commission, may
          suspend the person from office with or without pay, pending final disposition of
          the charge.
                    B. Any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of this subsection who is
          eligible for retirement benefits under the laws of this state providing for judicial
          retirement may be involuntarily retired, and any person holding an office named in
          that paragraph who is not eligible for retirement benefits under such laws may be
          removed from office, for disability seriously interfering with the performance of
          his duties, which is, or is likely to become, permanent in nature.
     (7) The Commission shall keep itself informed as fully as may be of circumstances
relating to the misconduct or disability of particular persons holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, receive complaints or reports, formal or informal,
from any source in this behalf and make such preliminary investigations as it may determine.  Its
orders for the attendance or testimony of witnesses or for the production of documents at any
hearing or investigation shall be enforceable by contempt proceedings in the District Court or by
a Master.
     (8) After such investigation as it deems necessary, the Commission may in its discretion
issue a private or public reprimand, or if the Commission determines that the situation merits
such action, it may institute formal proceedings and order a formal hearing to be held before it
concerning the public censure, removal, or retirement of a person holding an office named in
Paragraph A of in Subsection (6) of this Section, or it may in its discretion request the Supreme
Court to appoint an active or retired District Judge or Justice of a Court of Civil Appeals, or
retired Judge or Justice of the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court, as a Master to
hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report thereon to the Commission.  The Master
shall have all the power of a District Judge in the enforcement of orders pertaining to witnesses,
evidence, and procedure.  If, after formal hearing, or after considering the record and report of a
Master, the Commission finds good cause therefor, it shall issue an order of public censure or it
shall recommend to the Supreme Court the removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the
person in question holding an office named in Paragraph A of in Subsection (6) of this Section
and shall thereupon file with the Clerk of the Supreme Court the entire  record before the
Commission.
     (9) The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts
and in its discretion may, for good cause shown, permit the introduction of additional evidence
and shall order public censure, retirement or removal, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject
the recommendation.  Upon an order for involuntary retirement for disability or an order for
removal, the office in question shall become vacant.  The Supreme Court, in an order for
involuntary retirement for disability or an order for removal, may prohibit such person from
holding judicial office in the future.  The rights of an incumbent so retired to retirement benefits
shall be the same as if his retirement had been voluntary.
     (10) All papers filed with and proceedings before the Commission, Master or the
Supreme Court shall be privileged, unless otherwise provided by law, provided that upon being
filed in the Supreme Court the record loses its confidential character; and the filing of papers
with, and the giving of testimony before the Commission or a Master shall be privileged, unless
otherwise provided by law.  However, the Commission may issue a public statement through its
executive director or its Chairman at any time during any of its proceedings under this Section
when sources other than  the Commission cause notoriety concerning a Judge or the Commission
itself and the Commission determines that the best interests of a Judge or of the public will be
served by issuing the statement.
     (11) The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, and the Supreme Court.  Such rule shall afford to any person holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, against whom a proceeding is instituted to cause
his retirement or removal, due process of law for the procedure before the Commission, Masters,
and the Supreme Court in the same manner that any person whose property rights are in jeopardy
in an adjudicatory proceeding is entitled to due process of law, regardless of whether or not the
interest of the person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section in
remaining in active status is considered to be a right or a privilege.  Due process shall include the
right to notice, counsel, hearing, confrontation of his accusers, and all such other incidents of due
process as are ordinarily available in proceedings whether or not misfeasance is charged, upon
proof of which a penalty may be imposed.
     (12) No person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section
shall sit as a member of the Commission in any proceeding involving his own suspension,
censure, retirement or removal.  A recommendation of the Commission for the suspension,
censure, retirement, or removal of a Supreme Court Justice shall be determined by a tribunal of
seven (7) Court of Civil Appeals Justices selected by lot to serve in place of the Supreme Court. 
     (13) This Section 1 a is alternative to and cumulative of, the methods of removal of
persons holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section provided
elsewhere in this Constitution.

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) From and after January 1, 1973, the governing body of any county, city, town, school
district, or other political subdivision of the State, may exempt by its own action not less than
Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of persons,
married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for purposes of
payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability
Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of age or older,
including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political
subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the
voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the governing
body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an amount
not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market value of
residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or over shall
be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  An eligible
disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both exemptions
from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the subdivision has
adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the payment of any
debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to continue to levy and
collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so pledged until the debt
is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by which the
debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based on assessed value is
increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to market value,
provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall be rounded to
the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($5,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  In addition to this exemption, the
legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is disabled as described in
Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older from ad
valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature
by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional exemption
authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years of age or
older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older
may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An eligible
person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all residence
homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but the
legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1-d-1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law.  
However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of
the homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply
with governmental requirements.

laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes; actual places of religious
worship, also any property owned by a church or by a strictly religious society for the exclusive
use as a dwelling place for the ministry of such church or religious society, and which yields no
revenue whatever to such church or religious society; provided that such exemption shall not
extend to more property than is reasonably necessary for a dwelling place and in no event more
than one acre of land; places of burial not held for private or corporate profit; solar or wind
powered energy devices; all buildings used exclusively and owned by persons or associations of
persons for school purposes and the necessary furniture of all schools and property used
exclusively and reasonably necessary in conducting any association engaged in promoting the
religious, educational and physical development of boys, girls, young men or young women
operating under a State or National organization of like character; also the endowment funds of
such institutions of learning and religion not used with a view to profit; and when the same are
invested in bonds or mortgages, or in land or other property which has been and shall hereafter be
bought in by such institutions under foreclosure sales made to satisfy or protect such bonds or
mortgages, that such exemption of such land and property shall continue only for two years after
the purchase of the same at such sale by such institutions and no longer, and institutions of purely
public charity; and all laws exempting property from taxation other than the property mentioned
in this Section shall be null and void.
     (b) The Legislature may, by general law, exempt property owned by a disabled veteran or
by the surviving spouse and surviving minor children of a disabled veteran.  A disabled veteran is
a veteran of the armed services of the United States who is classified as disabled by the Veterans'
Administration or by a successor to that agency; or the military service in which he served.  A
veteran who is certified as having a disability of less than 10 percent is not entitled to an
exemption.  A veteran having a disability rating of not less than 10 percent nor more than 30
percent may be granted an exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $1,500.  A
veteran having a disability rating of more than 30 percent but not more than 50 percent may be
granted an exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $2,000.  A veteran having a
disability rating of more than 50 percent but not more than 70 percent may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $2,500.  A veteran who has a disability
rating of more than 70 percent, or a veteran who has a disability rating of not less than 10 percent
and has attained the age of 65, or a disabled veteran whose disability consists of the loss or loss
of use of one or more limbs, total blindness in one or both eyes, or paraplegia, may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $3,000.  The spouse and children of any
member of the United States Armed Forces who loses his life while on active duty will be
granted an exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $5,000.  A deceased disabled
veteran's surviving spouse and children may be granted an exemption which in the aggregate is
equal to the exemption to which the decedent was entitled at the time he died.

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years, but the members serving on said Board on the date
of adoption hereof shall complete the terms to which they were appointed.  In the event of the
resignation or death of any such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to
serve for the unexpired portion of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been
appointed.  The compensation for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be
foxed by the Legislature; and each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be
prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Nine Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($950,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the
purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($700,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations
shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or obligations issued and
sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of
Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board
are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas. 
In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the
Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in
bonds or obligations of the United States until such funds are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans who served not less than ninety (90)
continuous days, unless sooner discharged by reason of a service-connected disability, on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard or Marine Corps of the United States after
September 16, 1940, and who, upon the date of filing his or her application to purchase any land
is a citizen of the United States, is a bona fide resident of the State of Texas, and has not been
dishonorably discharged from any branch of the Armed Forces above-named and who at the time
of his or her enlistment, induction, commissioning, or drafting, was a bona fide resident of the
State of Texas, or who has resided in Texas at least five (5) years prior to the date of filing his or
her application, and provided that in the event of the death of an eligible Texas Veteran after the
veteran has filed with the Board an application and contract of sale to purchase through the Board
the tract selected by him or her and before the purchase has been completed, then the surviving
spouse may complete the transaction.  The unmarried surviving spouses of veterans who died in
the line of duty may also apply to purchase a tract through the Board provided the deceased
veterans meet the requirements set out in this Article with the exception that the deceased
veterans need not have served ninety (90) continuous days and provided further that the deceased
veterans were bona fide residents of the State of Texas at the time of enlistment, induction,
commissioning or drafting.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands the Veterans' Land Fund
which have been first offered for sale to veterans and which have not been sold may be sold or
resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, on such terms, at such prices and  rates of interest,
and under such rules and regulations as are now or may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such
additional bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal
due or to become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds, provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessaries to pay interest o
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided
herein in accordance with the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance and sale of such
additional bonds, until there are sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds hereafter issued and
sold, at which time all such moneys then remaining a part of said Veterans' Land Fund and
thereafter becoming a part of said Fund shall be governed as elsewhere provided herein.
     This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Land Program, there is hereby reposed in the
Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this Amendment,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the
Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

Sec. 65.  PUBLIC BONDS; INTEREST RATE; CONFLICTING RATES REPEALED;
VETERANS' LAND BOARD BONDS.  (a) Wherever the Constitution authorizes an agency,
instrumentality, or subdivision of the State to issue bonds and specifies the maximum rate of
interest which may be paid on such bonds issued pursuant to such constitutional authority, such
bonds may bear interest at rates not to exceed a weighted average annual interest rate of 6%
unless otherwise provided by Subsection (b) of this section.  All Constitutional provisions
specifically setting rates in conflict with this provision are hereby repealed.
     (b) Bonds issued by the Veterans' Land Board after the effective date of this subsection
bear interest at a rate or rates determined by the board, but the rate or rates may not exceed a net
effective interest rate of 10% per year unless otherwise provided by law.  A statute that is in
effect on the effective date of this subsection and that sets as a maximum interest rate payable on
bonds issued by the Veterans' Land Board a rate different from the maximum rate provided by
this subsection is ineffective unless reenacted by the legislature after that date.

prescribe such limitations and restrictions and enact such laws as may be necessary in order that
such federal matching money will be available for assistance and/or medical care for or on behalf
of needy persons.

Sec. 65.  PUBLIC BONDS; INTEREST RATE; CONFLICTING RATES REPEALED;
VETERANS' LAND BOARD BONDS.  (a) Wherever the Constitution authorizes an agency,
instrumentality, or subdivision of the State to issue bonds and specifies the maximum rate of
interest which may be paid on such bonds issued pursuant to such constitutional authority, such
bonds may bear interest at rates not to exceed a weighted average annual interest rate of 12%

specifically setting rates in conflict with this provision are hereby repealed.
     (b) Bonds issued by the Veterans' Land Board after the effective date of this subsection
bear interest at a rate or rates determined by the board, but the rate or rates may not exceed a net
effective interest rate of 10% per year unless otherwise provided by law.  A statute that is in
effect on the effective date of this subsection and that sets as a maximum interest rate payable on
bonds issued by the Veterans' Land Board a rate different from the maximum rate provided by

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) From and after January 1, 1973, the governing body of any county, city, town, school
district, or other political subdivision of the State, may exempt by its own action not less than
Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of persons,
married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for purposes of
payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability
Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of age or older,
including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political
subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the
voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the governing
body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an amount
not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market value of
residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or over shall
be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  An eligible
disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both exemptions
from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the subdivision has
adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the payment of any
debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to continue to levy and
collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so pledged until the debt
is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by which the
debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based on assessed value is
increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to market value,
provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall be rounded to
the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($5,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  In addition to this exemption, the
legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is disabled as described in
Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older from ad
valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature
by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional exemption
authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years of age or
older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older
may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An eligible
person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all residence
homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but the
legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1-d-1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law.  
However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of
the homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply
with governmental requirements.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision may exempt from ad valorem taxation a
percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a married or unmarried adult,
including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed forty percent (40%) for the years
1982 through 1984, thirty percent (30%) for the years 1985 through 1987, and twenty percent
(20%) in 1988 and each subsequent year.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized
pursuant to this subsection may not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the
legislature by general law prescribes other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption. 
An eligible adult is entitled to receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad
valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a
political subdivision may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature by general
law may prescribe procedures for the administration of residence homestead exemptions.
     (e 1) Subsection (e) of this section takes effect January 1, 1982.  This subsection expires
January 2, 1982.

Section 49-b-1.  BONDS ISSUED TO AUGMENT VETERANS' LAND FUND AND FOR
VETERANS' HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUND; APPROPRIATION WHEN MONEY IN
EITHER FUND IS NOT AVAILABLE.  (a) In addition to the general obligation bonds
authorized to be issued and to be sold by the Veterans' Land Board by Section 49-b of this
article, the Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue, and sell not to exceed $800 million in
bonds of the State of Texas to provide financing to veterans of the state in recognition of their
services to their state and country.
     (b) For purposes of this section, "veteran" means a person who served not less than 90
continuous days, unless sooner discharged by reason of a service connected disability, on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps of the United States after
September 16, 1940, and who, upon the date of filing his or her application for financial
assistance under this section is a citizen of the United States, is a bona fide resident of the State
of Texas, and was discharged from military service under honorable conditions from any branch
of the above-named Armed Forces and who at the time of his or her enlistment, induction,
commissioning, or drafting was a bona fide resident of the State of Texas or who has resided in
Texas at least five years immediately before the date of filing his or her application.  In the event
of the death of an eligible Texas veteran after the veteran has filed an application, the veteran's
surviving spouse may complete the transaction.  The term veteran also includes the unmarried
surviving spouse of a veteran who died in the line of duty, if the deceased veteran meets the
requirements set out in this section with the exception that the deceased veteran need not have
served 90 continuous days and if the deceased veteran was a bona fide resident at the time of
enlistment, induction, commissioning, or drafting.
     (c) The bonds shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued
in such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, notwithstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of this constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board.  All bonds issued and sold pursuant to Subsections (a) through (f) of this section shall,
after execution by the board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the
Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or
purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligation of the state under the
Constitution of Texas.
     (d) Three hundred million dollars of the state bonds authorized by this section shall be
used to augment the Veterans' Land Fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by the board
for the purpose of purchasing lands situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States
government or any agency thereof, the State of Texas or any subdivision thereof, or any person,
firm, or corporation.  The lands shall be sold to veterans in such quantities, on such terms, at
such prices, at such rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as may be provided by
law.  The expenses of the board in connection with the issuance of the bonds and the purchase
and sale of the lands may be paid from money in the fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall
continue to consist of any lands purchased by the board until the sale price therefor, together with
any interest and penalties due, have been received by the board (although nothing herein shall
prevent the board from accepting full payment for a portion of any tract,) and of the money
attributable to any bonds issued and sold by the board for the Veterans' Land Fund, which money
so attributable shall include but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of
such bonds; the money received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased
with other money attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or
resale of such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, incomes, rents, royalties, and any other
pecuniary benefit received by the board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity
or forfeiture for failure of any bidder for the purchase of such bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for any such lands; and interest received from investments of any such money. 
The principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds previously authorized by Section
49-b of this constitution shall be paid out of the moneys of the fund in conformance with the
constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds.  The principal of and interest on the general
obligation bonds authorized by this section for the benefit of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be
paid out of the money of the fund, but the money of the fund which is not immediately
committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of lands as herein
provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested bonds or obligations of
the United States until the money is needed for such purposes.
     (e) The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund is created, and $ 500 million of the state
bonds authorized by this section shall be used for the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund. 
Money in the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund shall be administered by the Veterans' Land
Board and shall be used for the purpose of making home mortgage loans to veterans for housing
within the State of Texas in such quantities, on such terms, at such prices, at such rates of
interest, and under such rules and regulations as may be authorized by law.  The expenses of the
board in connection with the issuance of the bonds and the making of the loans may be paid from
money in the fund.  The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund shall consist of any interest of the
board in all home mortgage loans made to veterans by the board pursuant to the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Program which the legislature may establish by appropriate legislation until,
with respect to any such home mortgage loan, the principal amount, together with any interest
and penalties due, have been received by the board; the money attributable to any bonds issued
and sold by the board to provide money for the fund, which money so attributable shall include
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; income, rents,
and any other pecuniary benefit received by the board as a result of making such loans; sums
received by way of indemnity or forfeiture for the failure of any bidder for such bonds to comply
with his bid and accept and pay for any such bonds; and interest received from the investment of
any such money.  The principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this
section for the benefit of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund shall be paid out of the money
of the fund, but the money of the fund which is not immediately committed to the payment of
principal and interest on such bonds, the making of home mortgage loans as herein provided, or
the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in bonds or obligations of the
United States until the money is needed for such purposes.
     (f) To the extent there is not money in either the Veterans' Land Fund or the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund as the case may be, available for the payment of principal of and
interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this section to provide money for either of
the funds, there is hereby appropriated out of the first money coming into the treasury in each
fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay
the principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds that mature or become due during
that fiscal year.
     (g) Receipt of all kinds of the funds determined by the board not to be required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds herein authorized, heretofore
authorized, and hereafter authorized by this constitution to be issued by the board to provide
money for either of the funds may be used by the board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing such bonds, to pay the principal of and interest on general obligation
bonds issued to provide money for the other fund, or to pay the principal of and interest on
revenue bonds of the board issued for the purposes of providing funds for the purchasing of lands
and making the sale thereof to veterans or making home mortgage loans to veterans as provided
by this section.  The revenue bonds shall be special obligations and payable only from the receipt
of the funds and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the Veterans' Land Board.  The
board is authorized to issue such revenue bonds from time to time which shall not exceed an
aggregate principal amount that can be fully retired from the receipts of the funds and other
revenues pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds.  The revenue bonds shall be issued in
such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, not withstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of the constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board. 
     (h) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program and the Veterans' Land
Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the
design and objects of this Amendment, including the power to delegate such duties,
responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURAL RULES.  (a) The Legislature, in order
to insure continuity of state and local governmental operations in periods of emergency resulting
from disasters caused by enemy attack, shall have the power and the immediate duty to provide
for prompt and temporary succession to the powers and duties of public offices, of whatever
nature and whether filled by election or appointment, the incumbents of which may become
unavailable for carrying on the powers and duties of such offices.  Provided, however, that
Article I of the Constitution of Texas, known as the "Bill of Rights" shall not be in any manner
affected, amended, impaired, suspended, repealed or suspended hereby.
     (b) When such a period of emergency or the immediate threat of enemy attack exists, the
Legislature may suspend procedural rules imposed by this Constitution that relate to:
                    (1) the order of business of the Legislature;
                    (2) the percentage of each house of the Legislature necessary to constitute a
          quorum;
                    (3) the requirement that a bill must be read on three days in each house before it
          has the force of law;
                    (4) the requirement that a bill must be referred to and reported from committee
          before its consideration; and
                    (5) the date on which laws passed by the Legislature take effect.
     (c) When such a period of emergency or the immediate threat of enemy attack exists, the
Governor, after consulting with the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, may suspend the constitutional requirement that the Legislature hold its sessions
in Austin, the seat of government.  When this requirement has been suspended, the Governor
shall determine a place other than Austin at which the Legislature will hold its sessions during
such period of emergency or immediate threat of enemy attack.  The Governor shall notify the
Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the place and time at
which the Legislature will meet.  The Governor may take security precautions, consistent with
the state of emergency, in determining the extent to which that information may be released.
     (d) To suspend the constitutional rules specified by Subsection (b) of this section, the
Governor must issue a proclamation and the House of Representatives and the Senate must
concur in the proclamation as provided by this section.
     (e) The Governor's proclamation must declare that a period of emergency resulting from
disasters caused by enemy attack exists, or that the immediate threat of enemy attack exists, and
that suspension of constitutional rules relating to legislative procedure is necessary to assure
continuity of state government.  The proclamation must specify the period, not to exceed two
years, during which the constitutional rules specified by Subsection (b) of this section are
suspended.
     (f) The House of Representatives and the Senate, by concurrent resolution approved by
the majority of the members present, must concur in the Governor's proclamation.  A resolution
of the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring in the Governor's proclamation
suspends the constitutional rules specified by Subsection (b) of this section for the period of time
specified by the Governor's proclamation.
     (g) The constitutional rules specified by Subsection (b) of this section may not be
suspended for more than two years under a single proclamation.  A suspension may be renewed,
however, if the Governor issues another proclamation as provided by Subsection (e) of this
section and the House of Representatives and the Senate, by concurrent resolution, concur in that
proclamation.

provided for by this Constitution.  In each such precinct there shall be elected one Justice of the
Peace and one Constable, each of whom shall hold his office for four years and until his
successor shall be elected and qualified; provided that in a county with a population of less than
150,000, according to the most recent federal census, in any precinct in which there may be a city
of 18,000 or more inhabitants, there shall be elected two Justices of the Peace.  
     (b) Each county shall, in the manner provided for justice of the peace and constable
precincts, be divided into four commissioners precincts in each of which there shall be elected by
the qualified voters thereof one County Commissioner, who shall hold his office for four years
and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.  The County Commissioners so chosen,
with the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court,
which shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this
Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.
     (c) When the boundaries of justice of the peace and constable precincts are changed, each
Justice and Constable in office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office
beginning on or after the effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct in which the
person resides for the term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in
boundaries places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or
appointed, abolishes the precinct for which he was elected or appointed, or temporarily results in
extra Justices or Constables serving in a precinct.  When, as a result of a change of precinct
boundaries, a vacancy occurs in the office of Justice of the Peace or Constable, the
Commissioners Court shall fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general election.
     (d) When the boundaries of commissioners precincts are changed, each commissioner in
office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office beginning on or after the
effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct to which each was elected or appointed
for the entire term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in boundaries
places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or appointed.

     (d) In the year 1985 and every 10 years thereafter, the legislature or an agency designated
by the legislature no later than August 31 of such year shall allocate by equitable formula the
annual appropriations made under Subsection (a) of this section to the governing boards of
eligible agencies and institutions of higher education.  The legislature shall review, or provide for
a review, of the allocation formula at the end of the fifth year of each 10 year allocation period. 
At that time adjustments may be made in the allocation formula, but no adjustment that will
prevent the payment of outstanding bonds and notes, both principal and interest, may be made.
     (e) Each governing board authorized to participate in the distribution of money under this
section is authorized to expend all money distributed to it for any of the purposes enumerated in
Subsection (a).  In addition unless a single bonding agency is designated as hereinafter provided,
such governing board may issue bonds and notes for the purposes of refunding bonds or notes
issued under this section or prior law, acquiring land either with or without permanent
improvements, constructing and equipping buildings or other permanent improvements, and for
major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other permanent improvements, and may pledge
up to 50 percent of the money allocated to such governing board pursuant to this section to
secure the payment of the principal and interest of such bonds or notes.  Proceeds from the
issuance of bonds or notes under this subsection shall be maintained in a local depository
selected by the governing board issuing the bonds or notes.  The bonds and notes issued under
this subsection shall be payable solely out of the money appropriated by this section and shall
mature serially or otherwise in not more than 10 years from their respective dates.  All bonds
issued under this section shall be sold only through competitive bidding and are subject to
approval by the attorney general.  Bonds approved by the attorney general shall be incontestable. 
The permanent university fund may be invested in the bonds and notes issued under this section. 
In lieu of the authority granted to each governing board herein, the legislature by general law may
designate a single agency to issue bonds and notes authorized under this section and transfer to
that agency the authority to collect and pledge money to the payment of such notes and bonds for
the purposes, to the extent, and subject to the restrictions of this section.  Provided, that such
agency shall be authorized to issue such bonds and notes for the benefit of an eligible institution
and pledge money collected hereunder only as directed by the governing board of each eligible
institution.
     (f) The funds appropriated by this section may not be used for the purpose of
constructing, equipping, repairing, or rehabilitating buildings or other permanent improvements
that are to be used for student housing, intercollegiate athletics, or auxiliary enterprises.
     (g) Except for that portion of the allocated funds that may be required to be transferred to
a single bonding agency, if one is created, the comptroller of public accounts shall make annual
transfers of the funds allocated pursuant to Subsection (d) directly to the governing boards of the
eligible institutions.
     (h) To assure efficient use of construction funds and the orderly development of physical
plants to accommodate the state's real need, the legislature may provide for the approval or
disapproval of all new construction projects at the eligible agencies and institutions entitled to
participate in the funding provided by this section.
     (i) The legislature by general law may dedicate portions of the state's revenues to the
creation of a dedicated fund ("the higher education fund") for the purposes expressed in
Subsection (a) of this section.  The legislature shall provide for administration of the fund, which
shall be invested in the manner provided for investment of the permanent university fund.  The
income from the investment of the higher education fund shall be credited to the higher education
fund until such time as the fund totals $2 billion.  The principal of the higher education fund shall
never be expended.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund reaches $2 billion, as
certified by the comptroller of public accounts, the dedication of general revenue funds provided
for in Subsection (a) of this section shall cease.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund
reaches $2 billion, and each year thereafter, 10 percent of the interest, dividends, and other
income accruing from the investments of the higher education fund during the previous fiscal
year shall be deposited and become part of the principal of the fund, and out of the remainder of
the annual income from the investment of the principal of the fund there shall be appropriated an
annual sum sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds and notes issued under
this section and the balance of the income shall be allocated, distributed, and expended as
provided for the appropriations made under Subsection (a).
     (j) The state systems and institutions of higher education designated in this section may
not receive any additional funds from the general revenue of the state for acquiring land with or
without permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other permanent
improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other permanent
improvements except that:
                    (1) in the case of fire or natural disaster the legislature may appropriate from the
          general revenue an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss of any building
          or other permanent improvement; and
                    (2) the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may, in cases of
          demonstrated need, which need must be clearly expressed in the body of the act,
          appropriate additional general revenue funds for acquiring land with or without
          permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other
          permanent improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or
          other permanent improvements.
This subsection does not apply to legislative appropriations made prior to the adoption of this
amendment.
     (k) Without the prior approval of the legislature, appropriations under this section may
not be expended for acquiring land with or without permanent improvements, or for constructing
and equipping buildings or other permanent improvements, for a branch campus or educational
center that is not a separate degree granting institution created by general law.
     (l) This section is self enacting upon the issuance of the governor's proclamation
declaring the adoption of the amendment, and the state comptroller of public accounts and the
state treasurer shall do all things necessary to effectuate this section.  This section does not
impair any obligation created by the issuance of any bonds and notes in accordance with prior
law, and all outstanding bonds and notes shall be paid in full, both principal and interest, in
accordance with their terms.  If the provisions of this section conflict with any other provisions of
this constitution, then the provisions of this section shall prevail, notwithstanding all such
conflicting provisions.

          general revenue an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss of any building
          or other permanent improvement; and
                    (2) the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may, in cases of
          demonstrated need, which need must be clearly expressed in the body of the act,

     (j) This section is self enacting on the issuance of the governor's proclamation declaring
the adoption of this amendment, and the state comptroller of public accounts and the state

obligation created by the issuance of bonds or notes in accordance with prior law, and all
outstanding bonds and notes shall be paid in full, both principal and interest, in accordance with
their terms, and the changes herein made in the allocation of the available university fund shall

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years, but the members serving on said Board on the date
of adoption hereof shall complete the terms to which they were appointed.  In the event of the
resignation or death of any such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to
serve for the unexpired portion of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been
appointed.  The compensation for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be
foxed by the Legislature; and each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be
prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Nine Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($950,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the
purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($700,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations
shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or obligations issued and
sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of
Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board
are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas. 
In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the
Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested in
bonds or obligations of the United States until such funds are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans, as they are now or may hereafter be defined
by the laws of the State of Texas.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands in the Veterans'
Land Fund which have not been sold or resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, and on such
terms, and at such prices and rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now or
may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such
additional bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal
due or to become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds, provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessaries to pay interest o
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided
herein in accordance with the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance and sale of such
additional bonds, until there are sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds hereafter issued and
sold, at which time all such moneys then remaining a part of said Veterans' Land Fund and
thereafter becoming a part of said Fund shall be governed as elsewhere provided herein.
     This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Land Program, there is hereby reposed in the
Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this Amendment,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the
Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

 Section 49-b-1.  BONDS ISSUED TO AUGMENT VETERANS' LAND FUND AND FOR
VETERANS' HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUND; APPROPRIATION WHEN MONEY IN
EITHER FUND IS NOT AVAILABLE.  (a) In addition to the general obligation bonds
authorized to be issued and to be sold by the Veterans' Land Board by Section 49-b of this
article, the Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue, and sell not to exceed $1.3 billion in
bonds of the State of Texas, $800 million of which have heretofore been authorized to provide
financing to veterans of the state in recognition of their services to their state and country.
     (b) For purposes of this section, "veteran" means a person who satisfies the definition of
"veteran" as is now or may hereafter be set forth by the laws of the State of Texas.
     (c) The bonds shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued
in such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, notwithstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of this constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board.  All bonds issued and sold pursuant to Subsections (a) through (f) of this section shall,
after execution by the board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the
Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or
purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligation of the state under the
Constitution of Texas.
     (d) Three hundred million dollars of the state bonds authorized by this section shall be
used to augment the Veterans' Land Fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by the board
for the purpose of purchasing lands situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States
government or any agency thereof, the State of Texas or any subdivision thereof, or any person,
firm, or corporation.  The lands shall be sold to veterans in such quantities, on such terms, at
such prices, at such rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as may be provided by
law.  The expenses of the board in connection with the issuance of the bonds and the purchase
and sale of the lands may be paid from money in the fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall
continue to consist of any lands purchased by the board until the sale price therefor, together with
any interest and penalties due, have been received by the board (although nothing herein shall
prevent the board from accepting full payment for a portion of any tract,) and of the money
attributable to any bonds issued and sold by the board for the Veterans' Land Fund, which money
so attributable shall include but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of
such bonds; the money received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased
with other money attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or
resale of such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, incomes, rents, royalties, and any other
pecuniary benefit received by the board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity
or forfeiture for failure of any bidder for the purchase of such bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for any such lands; and interest received from investments of any such money. 
The principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds previously authorized by Section
49-b of this constitution shall be paid out of the moneys of the fund in conformance with the
constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds.  The principal of and interest on the general
obligation bonds authorized by this section for the benefit of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be
paid out of the money of the fund, but the money of the fund which is not immediately
committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of lands as herein
provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested bonds or obligations of
the United States until the money is needed for such purposes.
     (e) The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund is created, and $ 1 billion of the state bonds
authorized by this section shall be used for the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund, $500 million
of which have heretofore been authorized.  Money in the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund
shall be administered by the Veterans' Land Board and shall be used for the purpose of making
home mortgage loans to veterans for housing within the State of Texas in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as may
be authorized by law.  The expenses of the board in connection with the issuance of the bonds
and the making of the loans may be paid from money in the fund.  The Veterans' Housing
Assistance Fund shall consist of any interest of the board in all home mortgage loans made to
veterans by the board pursuant to the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program which the
legislature may establish by appropriate legislation until, with respect to any such home mortgage
loan, the principal amount, together with any interest and penalties due, have been received by
the board; the money attributable to any bonds issued and sold by the board to provide money for
the fund, which money so attributable shall include but shall not be limited to the proceeds from
the issuance and sale of such bonds; income, rents, and any other pecuniary benefit received by
the board as a result of making such loans; sums received by way of indemnity or forfeiture for
the failure of any bidder for such bonds to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such
bonds; and interest received from the investment of any such money.  The principal of and
interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this section for the benefit of the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund shall be paid out of the money of the fund, but the money of the fund
which is not immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the
making of home mortgage loans as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein
provided may be invested in bonds or obligations of the United States until the money is needed
for such purposes.
     (f) To the extent there is not money in either the Veterans' Land Fund or the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund as the case may be, available for the payment of principal of and
interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this section to provide money for either of
the funds, there is hereby appropriated out of the first money coming into the treasury in each
fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay
the principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds that mature or become due during
that fiscal year.
     (g) Receipt of all kinds of the funds determined by the board not to be required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds herein authorized, heretofore
authorized, and hereafter authorized by this constitution to be issued by the board to provide
money for either of the funds may be used by the board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing such bonds, to pay the principal of and interest on general obligation
bonds issued to provide money for the other fund, or to pay the principal of and interest on
revenue bonds of the board issued for the purposes of providing funds for the purchasing of lands
and making the sale thereof to veterans or making home mortgage loans to veterans as provided
by this section.  The revenue bonds shall be special obligations and payable only from the receipt
of the funds and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the Veterans' Land Board.  The
board is authorized to issue such revenue bonds from time to time which shall not exceed an
aggregate principal amount that can be fully retired from the receipts of the funds and other
revenues pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds.  The revenue bonds shall be issued in
such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, not withstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of the constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board. 
     (h) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a

Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the

Section 49-d.  (a) It is hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Texas to encourage the
optimum development of the limited number of feasible sites available for the construction or
enlargement of dams and reservoirs, for the conservation of the public waters of this state, which
waters are held in trust for the use and benefit of the public, and to encourage the optimum
regional development of systems built for the filtration, treatment and transmission of
wastewater.  The proceeds from the sale of bonds deposited in the Texas Water Development
Fund may be used by the Texas Water Development Board, under such provisions as the
Legislature may prescribe by General Law, including the requirement of a permit for storage or
beneficial use, for the additional purposes of acquiring and developing storage facilities, and any
system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment and transportation of water or wastewater,
or any one or more of such purposes of methods, whether or not such system or works is
connected with a reservoir in which the state has a financial interest; provided, however, the
Texas Water Development Fund or any other state fund provided for water development,
transmission, transfer or filtration shall not be used to finance any project which contemplates or
results in the removal from the basin of origin of any surface water necessary to supply the
reasonable foreseeable future water requirements for the next ensuing fifty-year period within the
river basin of origin, except on a temporary, interim basis.
     Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law the Texas Water
Development Fund may be used for the conservation and development of water for the useful
purposes by construction or reconstruction or enlargement of reservoirs constructed or to be
constructed or enlarged within the State of Texas or on any stream constituting a boundary of the
State of Texas, together with any system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment and/or
transportation of water, by any one or more of the following governmental agencies: by the
United States of America or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by the State of
Texas or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by the political subdivisions or
bodies politic and corporate of the state; by interstate compact commissions of which the State of
Texas is a party; and by municipal corporations.  The Legislature shall provide terms and
conditions under which the Texas Water Development Board may sell, transfer or lease, in whole
or in part, any reservoir and associated system or works which the Texas Water Development
Board has financed in whole or in part.
     Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law, the Texas Water
Development Board may also execute long-term contracts with the United States or any of its
agencies for the acquisition and development of storage facilities in reservoirs constructed or to
be constructed by the Federal Government.  Such contacts when executed shall constitute general
obligations of the State of Texas in the same manner and with the same effect as state bonds
issued under the authority of the preceding Section 49-c of this Constitution, and the provisions
in said Section 49-c with respect to payment of principal and interest on state bonds issued shall
likewise apply with respect to payment of principal and interest required to be paid by said
contracts.  If storage facilities are required for a term of years, such contracts shall contain
provisions for renewal that will protect the state's investment.
     The aggregate of the bonds authorized hereunder shall not exceed $200,000,000 and shall
be in addition to the aggregate of the bonds previously authorized by said Section 49-c of Article
III of the Constitution.  The Legislature upon two-thirds (2/3) vote of the elected members of
each House, may authorize the Board to issue all or any portion of such $200,000,000 in
additional bonds herein authorized.
     The Legislature shall provide terms and conditions for the Texas Water Development
Board to sell, transfer or lease, in whole or in part, any acquired facilities or the right to use such
facilities at a price not less than the direct cost of the Board in acquiring the same; and the
Legislature may provide terms and conditions for the Board to sell any unappropriated waters of
the state that might be stored at such facilities.  As a prerequisite to the purchase of such storage
or water, the applicant therefor shall have secured a valid permit from the Texas Water
Commission or its successor authorizing the acquisition of such storage facilities or the water
impounded therein.  The money received from any sale, transfer or lease of facilities shall be
used to pay principal and interest on state bonds issued or contractual obligations incurred by the
Texas Water Development Board, provided that when moneys are sufficient to pay the full
amount of indebtedness then outstanding and the full amount of interest to accrue thereon, any
further sums received from the sale, transfer or lease of such facilities shall be deposited and used
as provided by law.  Money received from the sale of water, which shall include standing service,
may be used for the operation and maintenance of acquired facilities, and for payment of
principal and interest upon debt incurred.
Should the Legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of this Amendment, such acts shall not
be void by reason of their anticipatory character.

Sec. 1 a.  RETIREMENT, CENSURE, REMOVAL, AND COMPENSATION OF JUSTICES
AND JUDGES; STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT; PROCEDURE.  (1)
Subject to the further provisions of this Section, the Legislature shall provide for the retirement
and compensation of Justices and Judges of the Appellate Courts and District and Criminal
District Courts on account of length of service, age and disability, and for their reassignment to
active duty where and when needed.  The office of every such Justice and Judge shall become
vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy five (75) years or such earlier age, not less
than seventy (70) years, as the Legislature may prescribe; but in the case of an incumbent whose
term of office includes the effective date of this Amendment, this provision shall not prevent him
from serving the remainder of said term nor be applicable to him before his period or periods of
judicial service shall have reached a total of ten (10) years.
     (2) The name of the State Judicial Qualifications Commission is changed to The State
Commission on Judicial Conduct.  The Commission consists of eleven (11) members, to wit:  (i) 
one (1) Justice of a Court of Appeals; (ii)  one (1) District Judge; (iii)  two (2) members of the
State Bar, who have respectively practiced as such for over ten (10) consecutive years next

practice law nor holding any salaried public office or employment; (v)  one (1) Justice of the
Peace; (vi)  one (1) Judge of a Municipal Court; and, (vii)  one (1) Judge of a County Court at
Law; provided that no person shall be or remain a member of the Commission, who does not
maintain physical residence within this State, or who resides in, or holds a judgeship within or
for, the same Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission, or who shall have
ceased to retain the qualifications above specified for his respective class of membership, except
that the Justice of the Peace and the Judges of a Municipal Court and or a County Court at Law
shall be selected at large without regard to whether they reside or hold a judgeship in the same
Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission.  Commissioners of classes (i),
(ii), and (vii) above shall be chosen by the Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate,
those of class (iii) by the Board of Directors of the State Bar under regulations to be prescribed
by the Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate, those of class (iiii) by appointment
of the Governor with advice and consent of the Senate, and the commissioners of classes (v) and
(vi) by appointment of the Supreme Court as provided by law, with the advice and consent of the
Senate.
     (3) The regular term of office of Commissioners shall be six (6) years; but the initial
members of each of classes (i), (ii) and (iii) shall respectively be chosen for terms of four (4) and
six (6) years, and the initial members of class (iiii) for respective terms of two (2), four (4) and
six (6) years.  Interim vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as vacancies due to expiration
of a full term, but only for the unexpired portion of the term in question.  Commissioners may
succeed themselves in office only if having served less than three (3) consecutive years.
     (4) Commissioners shall receive no compensation for their services as such.  The
Legislature shall provide for the payment of the necessary expense for the operation of the
Commission.
     (5) The Commission may hold its meetings, hearings and other proceedings at such times
and places as it shall determine but shall meet at Austin at least once each year.  It shall annually
select one of its members as Chairman.  A quorum shall consist of six (6) members.  Proceedings
shall be by majority vote of those present, except that recommendations for retirement, censure,
suspension, or removal of any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6)
of this Section shall be by affirmative vote of at least six (6) members.
               (6)  A. Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
          by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution, may,
          subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for willful or
          persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas,
          incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation of the Code
          of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent
          with the proper performance of his duties or casts public discredit upon the
          judiciary or administration of justice.  Any person holding such office may be
          disciplined or censured, in lieu of removal from office, as provided by this
          section.  Any person holding an office specified in this subsection may be
          suspended from office with or without pay by the Commission immediately on
          being indicted by a State or Federal grand jury for a felony offense or charged
          with a misdemeanor involving official misconduct.  On the filing of a sworn
          complaint charging a person holding such office with willful or persistent
          violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence in
          performing the duties of the office, willful violation of the Code of Judicial
          Conduct, or willful and persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the
          proper performance of his duties or casts public discredit on the judiciary or on
          the administration of justice, the Commission, after giving the person notice and
          an opportunity to appear and be heard before the Commission, may recommend to
          the Supreme Court the suspension of such person from office.  The Supreme
          Court, after considering the record of such appearance and the recommendation of
          the Commission, may suspend the person from office with or without pay,
          pending final disposition of the charge.
                    B. Any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of this subsection who is
          eligible for retirement benefits under the laws of this state providing for judicial
          retirement may be involuntarily retired, and any person holding an office named in
          that paragraph who is not eligible for retirement benefits under such laws may be
          removed from office, for disability seriously interfering with the performance of
          his duties, which is, or is likely to become, permanent in nature.
                    C. The law relating to the removal, discipline, suspension, or censure of a Justice
          or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created by the
          Legislature as provided in this Constitution applies to a master or magistrate
          appointed as provided by law to serve a trial court of this State and to a retired or
          former Judge who continues as a judicial officer subject to an assignment to sit on
          a court of this State.  Under the law relating to the removal of an active Justice or
          Judge, the Commission and the review tribunal may prohibit a retired or former
          Judge from holding judicial office in the future or from sitting on a court of this
          State by assignment.
     (7) The Commission shall keep itself informed as fully as may be of circumstances
relating to the misconduct or disability of particular persons holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, receive complaints or reports, formal or informal,
from any source in this behalf and make such preliminary investigations as it may determine.  Its
orders for the attendance or testimony of witnesses or for the production of documents at any
hearing or investigation shall be enforceable by contempt proceedings in the District Court or by
a Master.
     (8) After such investigation as it deems necessary, the Commission may in its discretion
issue a private or public admonition, warning, reprimand, or requirement that the person obtain
additional training or education, or if the Commission determines that the situation merits such
action, it may institute formal proceedings and order a formal hearing to be held before it
concerning the public censure, removal, or retirement of a person holding an office or position
specified in Subsection (6) of this Section, or it may in its discretion request the Supreme Court
to appoint an active or retired District Judge or Justice of a Court of Appeals, or retired Judge or
Justice of the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court, as a Master to hear and take
evidence in any such matter, and to report thereon to the Commission.  The Master shall have all
the power of a District Judge in the enforcement of orders pertaining to witnesses, evidence, and
procedure.  If, after formal hearing, or after considering the record and report of a Master, the
Commission finds good cause therefor, it shall issue an order of public censure or it shall
recommend to a review tribunal the removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the person in
question holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section and shall
thereupon file with the tribunal the entire  record before the Commission.
     (9) A tribunal to review the Commission's recommendation for the removal or retirement
of a person holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section is composed
of seven (7) Justices or Judges of the Courts of Appeals who are selected by lot by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.  Each Court of Appeals shall designate one of its members for
inclusion in the list from which the selection is made.  Service on the tribunal shall be considered
part of the official duties of a judge, and no additional compensation may be paid for such
service.  The review tribunal shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and
in its discretion may, for good cause shown, permit the introduction of additional evidence. 
Within 90 days after the date on which the record is filed with the review tribunal, it shall order
public censure, retirement or removal, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the
recommendation.  A Justice, Judge, Master, or Magistrate may appeal a decision of the review
tribunal to the Supreme Court under the substantial evidence rule.  Upon an order for involuntary
retirement for disability or an order for removal, the office in question shall become vacant.  The
review tribunal, in an order for involuntary retirement for disability or an order for removal, may
prohibit such person from holding judicial office in the future.  The rights of an incumbent so
retired to retirement benefits shall be the same as if his retirement had been voluntary.
     (10) All papers filed with and proceedings before the Commission or a Master shall be
confidential, unless otherwise provided by law, and the filing of papers with, and the giving of
testimony before the Commission or a Master shall be privileged, unless otherwise provided by
law.  However, the Commission may issue a public statement through its executive director or its
Chairman at any time during any of its proceedings under this Section when sources other than 
the Commission cause notoriety concerning a Judge or the Commission itself and the
Commission determines that the best interests of a Judge or of the public will be served by
issuing the statement.
     (11) The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, review tribunal, and the Supreme Court.  Such rule shall provide the right of discovery
of evidence to a Justice, Judge, Master, or Magistrate after formal proceedings are instituted and
shall afford to any person holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section,
against whom a proceeding is instituted to cause his retirement or removal, due process of law
for the procedure before the Commission, Masters, review tribunal, and the Supreme Court in the
same manner that any person whose property rights are in jeopardy in an adjudicatory proceeding
is entitled to due process of law, regardless of whether or not the interest of the person holding an
office or position  specified in Subsection (6) of this Section in remaining in active status is
considered to be a right or a privilege.  Due process shall include the right to notice, counsel,
hearing, confrontation of his accusers, and all such other incidents of due process as are
ordinarily available in proceedings whether or not misfeasance is charged, upon proof of which a
penalty may be imposed.
     (12) No person holding an office specified in Subsection (6) of this Section shall sit as a
member of the Commission in any proceeding involving his own suspension, discipline, censure,
retirement or removal.
     (13) This Section 1 a is alternative to and cumulative of, the methods of removal of
persons holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section provided
elsewhere in this Constitution.
     (14) The Legislature may promulgate laws in furtherance of this Section that are not
inconsistent with its provisions.

Sec. 7a.  JUDICIAL DISTRICTS BOARD; REAPPORTIONMENT OF JUDICIAL
DISTRICTS.  (a) The Judicial Districts Board is created to reapportion the judicial districts
authorized by Article V, Section 7, of this constitution.
(b) The membership of the board consists of the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court who
serves as chairman, the presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the presiding
judge of each of the administrative judicial districts of the state, the president of the Texas
Judicial Council, and one person who is licensed to practice law in this state appointed by the
governor with the advice and consent of the senate for a term of four years.  In the event of a
vacancy in the appointed membership, the vacancy is filled for the unexpired term in the same
manner as the original appointment.
(c) A majority of the total membership of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business.  The adoption of a reapportionment order requires a majority vote of the total
membership of the board.
(d) The reapportionment powers of the board shall be exercised in the interims between regular
sessions of the legislature, except that a reapportionment may not be ordered by the board during
an interim immediately following a regular session of the legislature in which a valid and
subsisting statewide apportionment of judicial districts is enacted by the legislature.  The board
has other powers and duties as provided by the legislature and shall exercise its powers under the
policies, rules, standards, and conditions, not inconsistent with this section, that the legislature
provides.
(e) Unless the legislature enacts a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following
each federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than the first Monday of June of
the third year following the year in which the federal decennial census is taken to make a
statewide reapportionment of the districts.  The board shall complete its work on the
reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same
year.  If the Judicial Districts Board fails to make a statewide apportionment by that date, the
Legislative Redistricting Board established by Article III, Section 28, of this constitution shall
make a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts not later than the 150th day after the
final day for the Judicial Districts Board to make the reapportionment.
(f) In addition to the statewide reapportionment, the board may reapportion the judicial districts
of the state as the necessity for reapportionment appears by redesignating, in one or more
reapportionment orders, the county or counties that comprise the specific judicial districts
affected by those reapportionment orders.  In modifying any judicial district, no county having a
population as large or larger than the population of the judicial district being reapportioned shall
be added to the judicial district.
(g) Except as provided by Subsection (i) of this section, this section does not limit the power of
the legislature to reapportion the judicial districts of the state, to increase the number of judicial
districts, or to provide for consequent matters on reapportionment.  The legislature may provide
for the effect of a reapportionment made by the board on pending cases or the transfer of pending
cases, for jurisdiction of a county court where county court jurisdiction has been vested by law in
a district court affected by the reapportionment, for terms of the courts upon existing officers and
their duties, and for all other matters affected by the reapportionment.  The legislature may
delegate any of these powers to the board.  The legislature shall provide for the necessary
expenses of the board.
(h) Any judicial reapportionment order adopted by the board must be approved by a record vote
of the majority of the membership of both the senate and house of representatives before such
order can become effective and binding.
(i) The legislature, the Judicial Districts Board, or the Legislative Redistricting Board may not

which there may be a city of 18,000 or more inhabitants, there shall be elected two Justices of the
Peace, and in a county with a population of 150,000 or more, according to the most recent federal
census, each precinct may contain more than one Justice of the Peace Court.

precincts, be divided into four commissioners precincts in each of which there shall be elected by
the qualified voters thereof one County Commissioner, who shall hold his office for four years
and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.  The County Commissioners so chosen,
with the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court,
which shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this
Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.

Justice and Constable in office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office
beginning on or after the effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct in which the
person resides for the term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in
boundaries places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or
appointed, abolishes the precinct for which he was elected or appointed, or temporarily results in
extra Justices or Constables serving in a precinct.  When, as a result of a change of precinct
boundaries, a vacancy occurs in the office of Justice of the Peace or Constable, the
Commissioners Court shall fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general election.

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) From and after January 1, 1973, the governing body of any county, city, town, school
district, or other political subdivision of the State, may exempt by its own action not less than
Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of persons,
married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for purposes of
payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability
Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of age or older,
including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political
subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the
voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the governing
body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an amount
not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market value of
residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or over shall
be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  An eligible
disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both exemptions
from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the subdivision has
adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the payment of any
debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to continue to levy and
collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so pledged until the debt
is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by which the
debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based on assessed value is
increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to market value,
provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall be rounded to
the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($5,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  In addition to this exemption, the
legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is disabled as described in
Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older from ad
valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature
by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional exemption
authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years of age or
older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older
may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An eligible
person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all residence
homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but the
legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1-d-1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law.  
However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of
the homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply
with governmental requirements.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision may exempt from ad valorem taxation a
percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a married or unmarried adult,
including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed forty percent (40%) for the years
1982 through 1984, thirty percent (30%) for the years 1985 through 1987, and twenty percent
(20%) in 1988 and each subsequent year.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized
pursuant to this subsection may not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the
legislature by general law prescribes other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption. 
An eligible adult is entitled to receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad
valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a
political subdivision may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature by general
law may prescribe procedures for the administration of residence homestead exemptions.

     (d) If in the preceding year the state received from oil production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of oil production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  In computing the net amount of oil
production taxes received, the comptroller may not consider refunds paid as a result of oil
overcharge litigation.
     (e) If in the preceding year the state received from gas production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of gas production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  For the purposes of this subsection,
the comptroller shall adjust his computation of revenues to reflect only 12 months of collection.
     (f) The legislature may appropriate additional amounts to the economic stabilization fund.
     (g) During each fiscal biennium, the amount in the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount, excluding investment income, interest
income, and amounts borrowed from special funds, deposited in general revenue during the
preceding biennium.
     (h) In preparing an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium as required
by Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution, the comptroller shall estimate the amount of the
transfers that will be made under Subsections (b), (d), and (e) of this section.  The comptroller
shall deduct that amount from the estimate of anticipated revenues as if the transfers were made
on August 31 of that fiscal year.
     (i) The state treasurer shall credit to general revenue interest due to the economic
stabilization fund that would result in an amount in the economic stabilization fund that exceeds
the limit in effect under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (j) The comptroller, with the consent of the state treasurer may transfer money from the
economic stabilization fund to general revenue to prevent or eliminate a temporary cash
deficiency in general revenue.  The state treasurer shall return the amount transferred to the
economic stabilization fund as soon as practicable, but not later than August 31 of each odd
numbered year.  The comptroller shall allocate the depository interest as if the transfers had not
been made.  If the comptroller submits a statement to the governor and the legislature under
Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution when money from the economic stabilization fund is
in general revenue, the comptroller shall state that the transferred money is not available for
appropriation from general revenue.
     (k) Amounts from the economic stabilization fund may be appropriated during a regular
legislative session only for a purpose for which an appropriation from general revenue was made
by the preceding legislature and may be appropriated in a special session only for a purpose for
which an appropriation from general revenue was made in a preceding legislative session of the
same legislature.  An appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may be made only if the
comptroller certifies that appropriations from general revenue made by the preceding legislature
for the current biennium exceed available general revenues and cash balances for the remainder
of that biennium.  The amount of an appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed the difference between the comptroller's estimate of general revenue for the current
biennium at the time the comptroller receives for certification the bill making the appropriation
and the amount of general revenue appropriations for that biennium previously certified by the
comptroller.  Appropriations from the economic stabilization fund under this subsection may not
extend beyond the last day of the current biennium.  An appropriation from the economic
stabilization fund must be approved by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house
of the legislature.
     (l) If an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium prepared by the
comptroller pursuant to Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution is less than the revenues that
are estimated at the same time by the comptroller to be available for the current biennium, the
legislature may, by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house, appropriate for the
succeeding biennium from the economic stabilization fund an amount not to exceed this
difference.  Following each fiscal year, the actual amount of revenue shall be computed, and if
the estimated difference exceeds the actual difference, the comptroller shall transfer the amount
necessary from general revenue to the economic stabilization fund so that the actual difference
shall not be exceeded.  If all or a portion of the difference in revenue from one biennium to the
next results, at least in part, from a change in a tax rate or base adopted by the legislature, the
computation of revenue difference shall be adjusted to the amount that would have been
available had the rate or base not been changed.
     (m) In addition to the appropriation authority provided by Subsections (k) and (l) of this
section, the legislature may, by a two thirds vote of the members present in each house,
appropriate amounts from the economic stabilization fund at any time and for any purpose.
     (n) Money appropriated from the economic stabilization fund is subject to being withheld
or transferred, within any limits provided by statute, by any person or entity authorized to
exercise the power granted by Article XVI, Section 69, of this constitution.
     (o) In this section, "net" means the amount of money that is equal to the difference
between gross collections and refunds before the comptroller allocates the receipts as provided
by law.  (Added Nov. 8, 1988.)

Section 49-g.  SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER FUND; ISSUANCE OF BONDS;
USE OF FUNDS.  (a) The legislature may authorize (1) the appropriate agency to issue up to
$500 million in general obligation bonds and to use the proceeds of the bonds (without further
appropriation) to establish a superconducting super collider fund to be used in any manner
appropriate to fund undertakings related to a superconducting super collider research facility
sponsored or authorized by the United States government, and (2) the appropriate agency to grant
land or property, whether or not acquired from the proceeds of the bonds, to the United States
government for undertakings related to a superconducting super collider research facility.  The
superconducting super collider fund shall contain a project account, an interest and sinking
account and such other accounts as may be authorized by the legislature.  The fund shall be
composed of the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this section, together with any income from
investment of money in the fund, amounts received pursuant to Subsection (b) hereof, and any
other amounts authorized to be deposited in the fund by the legislature.
     (b) Bonds issued under this section constitute a general obligation of the state.  While any
of the bonds or interest on the bonds is outstanding and unpaid, there is appropriated out of the
first money coming into the treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated in this
constitution, the amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds that mature or
become due during the fiscal year, less any amount in the interest and sinking account at the end
of the preceding fiscal year that is pledged to the payment of the bonds or interest.
     (c) The legislature may require review or approval of the issuance of the bonds, of the use
of the bond proceeds, or of the rules adopted by an agency to govern the use of the bond
proceeds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, any entity created or directed
to conduct this review and approval may include members, or appointees of members, of the
executive, legislative, and judicial departments of state government. 
     (d) Should the legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of the adoption of this
section, such acts shall not be void by reason of their anticipatory character.

funds, and the principal arising from the sale of the lands hereinbefore set apart to said school
fund, shall be the permanent school fund, and all the interest derivable therefrom and the taxes
herein authorized and levied shall be the available school fund.  The available school fund shall

Sec. 5.  CITY OF AMARILLO; WICHITA COUNTY; JEFFERSON COUNTY; CREATION
AND FUNDING OF HOSPITAL DISTRICTS.  (a) The Legislature may by law authorize the
creation of two hospital districts, one to be coextensive with and have the same boundaries as the
incorporated City of Amarillo, as such boundaries now exist or as they may hereafter be lawfully
extended, and the other to be coextensive with Wichita County.
     If such district or districts are created, they may be authorized to levy a tax not to exceed
Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation of taxable property
within the district; provided, however, no tax may be levied until approved by a majority vote of
the participating resident qualified property taxpaying voters who have duly rendered their
property for taxation.  The maximum rate of tax may be changed at subsequent elections so long
as obligations are not impaired, and not to exceed the maximum limit of Seventy five Cents
(75) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation, and no election shall be required by
subsequent changes in the boundaries of the City of Amarillo.
     If such tax is authorized, no political subdivision or municipality within or having the
same boundaries as the district may levy a tax for medical or hospital care for needy individuals,
nor shall they maintain or erect hospital facilities, but the district shall by resolution assume all
such responsibilities and shall assume all of the liabilities and obligations (including bonds and
warrants) of such subdivisions or municipalities or both.  The maximum tax rate submitted shall
be sufficient to discharge such obligations, liabilities, and responsibilities, and to maintain and
operate the hospital system, and the Legislature may authorize the district to issue tax bonds for
the purpose of the purchase, construction, acquisition, repair or renovation of improvements and
initially equipping the same, and such bonds shall be payable from said Seventy five Cents (75)
tax.  The Legislature shall provide for transfer of title to properties to the district.
     (b) The Legislature may by law permit the County of Potter (in which the City of
Amarillo is partially located) to render financial aid to that district by paying a part of the
expenses of operating and maintaining the system and paying a part of the debts of the district
(whether assumed or created by the district) and may authorize the levy of a tax not to exceed
Ten Cents (10) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation (in addition to other taxes
permitted by this Constitution) upon all property within the county but without the City of
Amarillo at the time such levy is made for such purposes.  If such tax is authorized, the district
shall by resolution assume the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities of the county in the
manner and to the extent hereinabove provided for political subdivisions having boundaries
coextensive with the district, and the county shall not thereafter levy taxes (other than herein
provided) for hospital purposes nor for providing hospital care for needy individuals of the
county.
     (c) The Legislature may by law authorize the creation of a hospital district within
Jefferson County, the boundaries of which shall include only the area comprising the Jefferson
County Drainage District No. 7 and the Port Arthur Independent School District, as such
boundaries existed on the first day of January, 1957, with the power to issue bonds for the sole
purpose of purchasing a site for, and the construction and initial equipping of, a hospital system,
and with the power to levy a tax of not to exceed Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) valuation of property therein for the purpose of paying the principal and
interest on such bonds.
     The creation of such hospital district shall not be final until approved at an election by a
majority of the resident property taxpaying voters voting at shall election who have duly rendered
their property for taxation upon the tax rolls of either said Drainage or said School District, nor
shall such bonds be issued or such tax be levied until so approved by such voters.
     The district shall not have the power to levy any tax for maintenance or operation of the
hospital or facilities, but shall contract with other political subdivisions of the state or private
individuals, associations, or corporations for such purposes.
     If the district hereinabove authorized is finally created, no other hospital district may be
created embracing any part of the territory within its boundaries, but the Legislature by law may
authorize the creation of a hospital district incorporating therein the remainder of Jefferson
County, having the powers and duties and with the limitations presently provided by Article IX,
Section 4, of the Constitution of Texas, except that such district shall be confirmed at an election
wherein the resident qualified property taxpaying voters who have duly rendered their property
within such proposed district for taxation on the county rolls shall be eligible to vote.  A majority
of those participating in the election voting in favor of the district shall be necessary for its
confirmation and for bonds to be issued.
     (d)  Should the Legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of the adoption of this
amendment, such Acts shall not be invalid because of their anticipatory character.
     (e)  The legislature by law may authorize Randall County to render financial assistance to
the Amarillo Hospital District by paying part of the district's operating and maintenance expenses
and the debts assumed or created by the district and to levy a tax for that purpose in an amount
not to exceed seventy five cents (75) on the One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation on all
property in Randall County that is not within the boundaries of the City of Amarillo or the South
Randall County Hospital District.  This tax is in addition to any other tax authorized by this
constitution.  If the tax is authorized by the legislature and approved by the voters of the area to
be taxed, the Amarillo Hospital District shall, by resolution, assume the responsibilities,
obligations, and liabilities of Randall County in accordance with Subsection (a) of this section
and, except as provided by this subsection, Randall County may not levy taxes or issue bonds for
hospital purposes or for providing hospital care for needy inhabitants of the county.  Not later
than the end of the first tax year during which taxes are levied under this subsection, Randall
County shall deposit in the State Treasury to the credit of the General Revenue Fund $45,000 to
reimburse the state for the cost of publishing the resolution required by this subsection.
     (f)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article IX of this constitution, if a hospital district
was created or authorized under a constitutional provision that includes a description of the
district's boundaries or jurisdiction, the legislature by law may authorize the district to change its
boundaries or jurisdiction.  The change must be approved by a majority of the qualified voters of
the district voting at an election called and held for that purpose.

     (b) The Texas growth fund is created as a trust fund.  Except as otherwise provided by
this section, the fund is subject to the general laws of this state governing private sector trusts. 
The governing boards of the permanent university fund, the permanent school fund, the Teacher
Retirement System of Texas, the Employees Retirement System of Texas, and any other pension
system created under this constitution or by statute of this state in their sole discretion may make
investments in the fund.
     (c) The fund is managed by a board of trustees consisting of four public members
appointed by the governor and one member from and elected by the membership of each of the
following:
                    (1) the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System;

          management of investments under this section with a private investment
          management firm or with an investing fund or system electing a member of the
          board of trustees.
     (g) In making investments, including venture capital investments, the board of trustees
shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of
ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering
the probable income as well as the probable safety of the capital of the fund.  All investments of
the fund shall be directly related to the creation, retention, or expansion of employment
opportunity and economic growth in Texas.  In making venture capital investments, all other
material matters being equal, the board of trustees shall invest in technological advances that
could be expected to result in the greatest increase in employment opportunity and economic
growth in Texas.
     (h) The board of trustees shall establish and operate the fund to the extent practical under
the generally accepted business procedures relating to a mutual fund and shall value the
investments for determining the purchase or sales price of participating shares of investing funds
or systems participating in the fund consistent with investment contracts.  Evidences of
participation in the fund shall be held by the state treasurer in keeping with the custodial
responsibilities of that office.
     (i) An investing fund or system, without liability at law or in equity to members of the
governing board of the fund or system in their personal or official capacities, may cumulatively

investing fund or system, as determined at the end of each fiscal year.
     (j) The board of trustees shall establish criteria for the investment of not more than 10
percent of the fund in venture capital investments.  Not more than 25 percent of the funds

the remainder of the funds available for venture capital investments must be matched at least
equally by funds from sources other than the fund, with matching amounts established by the
board of trustees.  The board of trustees shall also establish criteria for the investment of not less
than 50 percent of the fund in equity or debt security, or a combination of equity and debt
security, for the initial construction, expansion, or modernization of business or industrial
facilities in Texas.  The board of trustees may invest in money funds whose underlying
investments are consistent and acceptable under the investment policy of the fund.
     (k) On a quarterly basis, the amount of income realized on investments under this section
shall be distributed to each of the systems and funds investing in the Texas growth fund in
proportion to the number of participating shares of each investing system and fund.  Capital
appreciation becomes a part of the corpus of the Texas growth fund and shall be distributed in
accordance with the investment contracts.
     (l) The board of trustees shall make arrangements to begin liquidation, phase out
investments, and return the principal and capital gains on investments to the investors in the fund
not later than the 10th anniversary of the date of the adoption of this section.  Except under
unusual circumstances where it may be necessary to protect investments previously made, further
investments may not be made in or by the fund after the 10th anniversary of the date of the

Sec. 49 g.  ECONOMIC STABILIZATION FUND.  (Text of section as added by Acts 1987,
70th Leg., R.S., H.J.R. 2.)  (a) The economic stabilization fund is established as a special fund in
the state treasury.
     (b) The comptroller shall, not later than the 90th day of each biennium, transfer to the
economic stabilization fund one half of any unencumbered positive balance of general revenues
on the last day of the preceding biennium.  If necessary, the comptroller shall reduce the amount
transferred in proportion to the other amounts prescribed by this section to prevent the amount in
the fund from exceeding the limit in effect for that biennium under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (c) Not later than the 90th day of each fiscal year, the comptroller of public accounts shall
transfer from general revenue to the economic stabilization fund the amounts prescribed by
Subsections (d) and (e) of this section.  However, if necessary, the comptroller shall reduce
proportionately the amounts transferred to prevent the amount in the fund from exceeding the
limit in effect for that biennium under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (d) If in the preceding year the state received from oil production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of oil production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  In computing the net amount of oil
production taxes received, the comptroller may not consider refunds paid as a result of oil
overcharge litigation.
     (e) If in the preceding year the state received from gas production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of gas production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  For the purposes of this subsection,
the comptroller shall adjust his computation of revenues to reflect only 12 months of collection.
     (f) The legislature may appropriate additional amounts to the economic stabilization fund.
     (g) During each fiscal biennium, the amount in the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount, excluding investment income, interest
income, and amounts borrowed from special funds, deposited in general revenue during the
preceding biennium.
     (h) In preparing an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium as required
by Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution, the comptroller shall estimate the amount of the
transfers that will be made under Subsections (b), (d), and (e) of this section.  The comptroller
shall deduct that amount from the estimate of anticipated revenues as if the transfers were made
on August 31 of that fiscal year.
     (i) The state treasurer shall credit to general revenue interest due to the economic
stabilization fund that would result in an amount in the economic stabilization fund that exceeds
the limit in effect under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (j) The comptroller, with the consent of the state treasurer may transfer money from the
economic stabilization fund to general revenue to prevent or eliminate a temporary cash
deficiency in general revenue.  The state treasurer shall return the amount transferred to the
economic stabilization fund as soon as practicable, but not later than August 31 of each odd
numbered year.  The comptroller shall allocate the depository interest as if the transfers had not
been made.  If the comptroller submits a statement to the governor and the legislature under
Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution when money from the economic stabilization fund is
in general revenue, the comptroller shall state that the transferred money is not available for
appropriation from general revenue.
     (k) Amounts from the economic stabilization fund may be appropriated during a regular
legislative session only for a purpose for which an appropriation from general revenue was made
by the preceding legislature and may be appropriated in a special session only for a purpose for
which an appropriation from general revenue was made in a preceding legislative session of the
same legislature.  An appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may be made only if the
comptroller certifies that appropriations from general revenue made by the preceding legislature
for the current biennium exceed available general revenues and cash balances for the remainder
of that biennium.  The amount of an appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed the difference between the comptroller's estimate of general revenue for the current
biennium at the time the comptroller receives for certification the bill making the appropriation
and the amount of general revenue appropriations for that biennium previously certified by the
comptroller.  Appropriations from the economic stabilization fund under this subsection may not
extend beyond the last day of the current biennium.  An appropriation from the economic
stabilization fund must be approved by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house
of the legislature.
     (l) If an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium prepared by the
comptroller pursuant to Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution is less than the revenues that
are estimated at the same time by the comptroller to be available for the current biennium, the
legislature may, by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house, appropriate for the
succeeding biennium from the economic stabilization fund an amount not to exceed this
difference.  Following each fiscal year, the actual amount of revenue shall be computed, and if
the estimated difference exceeds the actual difference, the comptroller shall transfer the amount
necessary from general revenue to the economic stabilization fund so that the actual difference
shall not be exceeded.  If all or a portion of the difference in revenue from one biennium to the
next results, at least in part, from a change in a tax rate or base adopted by the legislature, the
computation of revenue difference shall be adjusted to the amount that would have been
available had the rate or base not been changed.
     (m) In addition to the appropriation authority provided by Subsections (k) and (l) of this
section, the legislature may, by a two thirds vote of the members present in each house,
appropriate amounts from the economic stabilization fund at any time and for any purpose.
     (n) Money appropriated from the economic stabilization fund is subject to being withheld
or transferred, within any limits provided by statute, by any person or entity authorized to
exercise the power granted by Article XVI, Section 69, of this constitution.
     (o) In this section, "net" means the amount of money that is equal to the difference
between gross collections and refunds before the comptroller allocates the receipts as provided
by law.  (Added Nov. 8, 1988.)

of the bond proceeds, or of the rules adopted by an agency to govern the use of the bond
proceeds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, any entity created or directed

Sec. 71.  TEXAS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS INCUBATOR
FUNDS; BONDS.  (a) The legislature by law may establish a Texas product development fund to
be used without further appropriation solely in furtherance of a program established by the
legislature to aid in the development and production of new or improved products in this state. 
The fund shall contain a program account, an interest and sinking account, and other accounts
authorized by the legislature.  To carry out the program authorized by this subsection, the
legislature may authorize loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments using money in the
Texas product development fund and the issuance of up to $25 million of general obligation
bonds to provide initial funding of the Texas product development fund.  The Texas product
development fund is composed of the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this subsection, loan
repayments, guarantee fees, royalty receipts, dividend income, and other amounts received by the
state from loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments made under this subsection and any
other amounts required to be deposited in the Texas product development fund by the legislature.
     (b) The legislature by law may establish a Texas small business incubator fund to be used
without further appropriation solely in furtherance of a program established by the legislature to
foster and stimulate the development of small businesses in the state.  The fund shall contain a
project account, an interest and sinking account, and other accounts authorized by the legislature. 
A small business incubator operating under the program is exempt from ad valorem taxation in
the same manner as an institution of purely public charity under Article VIII, Section 2, of this
constitution.  To carry out the program authorized by this subsection, the legislature may
authorize loans and grants of money in the Texas small business incubator fund and the issuance
of up to $20 million of general obligation bonds to provide initial funding of the Texas small
business incubator fund.  The Texas small business incubator fund is composed of the proceeds
of the bonds authorized by this subsection, loan repayments, and other amounts received by the
state for loans or grants made under this subsection and any other amounts required to be
deposited in the Texas small business incubator fund by the legislature.
     (c) The legislature may require review and approval of the issuance of bonds under this
section, of the use of the bond proceeds, or of the rules adopted by an agency to govern use of the
bond proceeds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, any entity created or
directed to conduct this review and approval may include members, or appointees of members, of
the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of state government.
     (d) Bonds authorized under this section constitute a general obligation of the state.  While
any of the bonds or interest on the bonds is outstanding and unpaid, there is appropriated out of
the first money coming into the treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this
constitution, the amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds that mature or
become due during the fiscal year, less any amount in any interest and sinking account at the end
of the preceding fiscal year that is pledged to payment of the bonds or interest.

appointment of the Governor is made during the recess of the Senate, the Governor shall
nominate the appointee, or some other person to fill the vacancy, to the Senate during the first ten
days of its next session following the appointment.  If the Senate does not confirm a person under
this subsection, the Governor shall nominate in accordance with this section the recess appointee
or another person to fill the vacancy during the first ten days of each subsequent session of the
Senate until a confirmation occurs.  If the Governor does not nominate a person to the Senate
during the first ten days of a session of the Senate as required by this subsection, the Senate at
that session may consider the recess appointee as if the Governor had nominated the appointee.
     (d) If the Senate, at any special session, does not take final action to confirm or reject a
previously unconfirmed recess appointee or another person nominated to fill the vacancy for
which the appointment was made:
                    (1) the Governor after the session may appoint another person to fill the vacancy;

          entitled to continue in office until the earlier of the following occurs:
                              (A) the Senate rejects the appointee at a subsequent session; or
                              (B) the Governor appoints another person to fill the vacancy under
               Subdivision (1) of this subsection.
     (e) If the Senate, at a regular session, does not take final action to confirm or reject a
previously unconfirmed recess appointee or another person nominated to fill the vacancy for
which the appointment was made, the appointee or other person, as appropriate, is considered to
be rejected by the Senate when the Senate session ends.
     (f) If an appointee is rejected, the office shall immediately become vacant, and the
Governor shall, without delay, make further nominations, until a confirmation takes place.  If a
person has been rejected by the Senate to fill a vacancy, the Governor may not appoint the person
to fill the vacancy or, during the term of the vacancy for which the person was rejected, to fill
another vacancy in the same office or on the same board, commission, or other body.
     (g) Appointments to vacancies in offices elective by the people shall only continue until
the next general election.
     (h) The Legislature by general law may limit the term to be served by a person appointed
by the Governor to fill a vacancy in a state or district office to a period that ends before the
vacant term otherwise expires or, for an elective office, before the next election at which the
vacancy is to be filled, if the appointment is made on or after November 1 preceding the general
election for the succeeding term of the office of Governor and the Governor is not elected at that
election to the succeeding term.
     (i) For purposes of this section, the expiration of a term of office or the creation of a new
office constitutes a vacancy.
     (j) Actions by the state board, commission or other body which otherwise be invalid due
to invalid office holders are hereby validated.  This subsection (j) of Section 12 of Article IV of
this Constitution shall expire on Jan. 1, 1991.

Section 49-b.  VETERAN'S LAND BOARD; BOND ISSUE; VETERANS' LAND FUND;
PURCHASE OF LANDS AND RESALE TO TEXAS VETERANS.  By virtue of prior
Amendments to this Constitution, there has been created a governmental agency of the State of
Texas performing governmental duties which has been designated the Veterans' Land Board. 
Said Board shall continue to function for the purposes specified in all of the prior Constitutional
Amendments except as modified herein.  Said Board shall be composed of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office and two (2) citizens of the State of Texas, one (1) of whom shall be well
versed in veterans' affairs and one (1) of whom shall be well versed in finances.  One (1) such
citizen member shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, be appointed biennially by the
Governor to serve for a term of four (4) years.  In the event of the resignation or death of any
such citizen member, the Governor shall appoint a replacement to serve for the unexpired portion
of the term to which the deceased or resigning member had been appointed.  The compensation
for the said citizen member shall be as is now or may hereafter be foxed by the Legislature; and
each shall make bond in such amount as is now or may hereafter be prescribed by the Legislature.
     The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall act as Chairman of said Board and
shall be the administrator of the Veterans' Land Program under such terms and restrictions as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law.  In the absence or illness of said Commissioner, the
Chief Clerk of the General Land Office shall be the Acting Chairman of said Board with the
same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Nine Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($950,000,000) in the bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the
purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund, Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($700,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations
shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by said
Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the weighted
average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in
the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds may
not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or obligations issued and
sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of
Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued and sold by said Board
are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations of the State of Texas. 
In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any such bonds, the
Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teachers' Retirement Funds, the Permanent University
Funds, and Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the money attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include,
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds; the moneys
received from the sale or resale of at lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds; the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the future of any bidder for the purchase of any bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds heretofore and
hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in conformance with
the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said Fund which are not
immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of
lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested as
authorized by law until such moneys are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Purpose Revenue Fund to be appropriated
to such purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming part of said Fund thereafter
shall likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division which
portion shall be set aside and remain part of such Division for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest thereon, together with
the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said
Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said Board; but there may be
no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of any of the bonds issued
and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Find.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans, as they are now or may hereafter be defined
by the laws of the State of Texas.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands in the Veterans'
Land Fund which have not been sold or resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, and on such
terms, and at such prices and rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now or
may hereafter be provided by law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the moneys attributable to any bonds hereafter
issued and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided
by law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction,
legal fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the
purchase and sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such
additional bonds, such expenses to added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said
Board; for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such

Section 49-b-1.  BONDS ISSUED TO AUGMENT VETERANS' LAND FUND AND FOR
VETERANS' HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUND; APPROPRIATION WHEN MONEY IN
EITHER FUND IS NOT AVAILABLE.  (a) In addition to the general obligation bonds
authorized to be issued and to be sold by the Veterans' Land Board by Section 49-b of this
article, the Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue, and sell not to exceed $1.3 billion in
bonds of the State of Texas, $800 million of which have heretofore been authorized to provide
financing to veterans of the state in recognition of their services to their state and country.
     (b) For purposes of this section, "veteran" means a person who satisfies the definition of
"veteran" as is now or may hereafter be set forth by the laws of the State of Texas.
     (c) The bonds shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest; shall be issued
in such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, notwithstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of this constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board.  All bonds issued and sold pursuant to Subsections (a) through (f) of this section shall,
after execution by the board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas, registration by the
Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or
purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligation of the state under the
Constitution of Texas.
     (d) Three hundred million dollars of the state bonds authorized by this section shall be
used to augment the Veterans' Land Fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by the board
for the purpose of purchasing lands situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States
government or any agency thereof, the State of Texas or any subdivision thereof, or any person,
firm, or corporation.  The lands shall be sold to veterans in such quantities, on such terms, at
such prices, at such rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as may be provided by
law.  The expenses of the board in connection with the issuance of the bonds and the purchase
and sale of the lands may be paid from money in the fund.  The Veterans' Land Fund shall
continue to consist of any lands purchased by the board until the sale price therefor, together with
any interest and penalties due, have been received by the board (although nothing herein shall
prevent the board from accepting full payment for a portion of any tract,) and of the money
attributable to any bonds issued and sold by the board for the Veterans' Land Fund, which money
so attributable shall include but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of
such bonds; the money received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased
with other money attributable to such bonds; the interest and penalties received from the sale or
resale of such lands, or rights therein; the bonuses, incomes, rents, royalties, and any other
pecuniary benefit received by the board from any such lands; sums received by way of indemnity
or forfeiture for failure of any bidder for the purchase of such bonds to comply with his bid and
accept and pay for any such lands; and interest received from investments of any such money. 
The principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds previously authorized by Section
49-b of this constitution shall be paid out of the moneys of the fund in conformance with the
constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds.  The principal of and interest on the general
obligation bonds authorized by this section for the benefit of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be
paid out of the money of the fund, but the money of the fund which is not immediately
committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the purchase of lands as herein
provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided may be invested as authorized by law
until the money is needed for such purposes.
     (e) The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund is created, and $ 1 billion of the state bonds
authorized by this section shall be used for the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund, $500 million
of which have heretofore been authorized.  Money in the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund
shall be administered by the Veterans' Land Board and shall be used for the purpose of making
home mortgage loans to veterans for housing within the State of Texas in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as may
be authorized by law.  The expenses of the board in connection with the issuance of the bonds
and the making of the loans may be paid from money in the fund.  The Veterans' Housing
Assistance Fund shall consist of any interest of the board in all home mortgage loans made to
veterans by the board pursuant to the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program which the
legislature may establish by appropriate legislation until, with respect to any such home mortgage
loan, the principal amount, together with any interest and penalties due, have been received by
the board; the money attributable to any bonds issued and sold by the board to provide money for
the fund, which money so attributable shall include but shall not be limited to the proceeds from
the issuance and sale of such bonds; income, rents, and any other pecuniary benefit received by
the board as a result of making such loans; sums received by way of indemnity or forfeiture for
the failure of any bidder for such bonds to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such
bonds; and interest received from the investment of any such money.  The principal of and
interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this section for the benefit of the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund shall be paid out of the money of the fund, but the money of the fund
which is not immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such bonds, the
making of home mortgage loans as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein
provided may be invested as authorized by law until the money is needed for such purposes.
     (f) To the extent there is not money in either the Veterans' Land Fund or the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund as the case may be, available for the payment of principal of and
interest on the general obligation bonds authorized by this section to provide money for either of
the funds, there is hereby appropriated out of the first money coming into the treasury in each
fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay
the principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds that mature or become due during
that fiscal year.
     (g) Receipt of all kinds of the funds determined by the board not to be required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds herein authorized, heretofore
authorized, and hereafter authorized by this constitution to be issued by the board to provide
money for either of the funds may be used by the board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing such bonds, to pay the principal of and interest on general obligation
bonds issued to provide money for the other fund, or to pay the principal of and interest on
revenue bonds of the board issued for the purposes of providing funds for the purchasing of lands
and making the sale thereof to veterans or making home mortgage loans to veterans as provided
by this section.  The revenue bonds shall be special obligations and payable only from the receipt
of the funds and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the Veterans' Land Board.  The
board is authorized to issue such revenue bonds from time to time which shall not exceed an
aggregate principal amount that can be fully retired from the receipts of the funds and other
revenues pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds.  The revenue bonds shall be issued in
such forms and denominations, upon such terms, at such times and places, and in such
installments as may be determined by the board; and, not withstanding the rate of interest
specified by any other provision of the constitution, shall bear a rate or rates of interest fixed by
the board. 
     (h) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program and the Veterans' Land
Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the
design and objects of this Amendment, including the power to delegate such duties,
responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

          according to records of the General Land Office;
                    (2) the land was not patentable under the law in effect immediately before the

          which dates from at least as early as January 1, 1941; and

               and penalties associated with any period of delinquency of the taxes;
               provided, however, that in the event that public records concerning the tax
               payments on the land are unavailable for any period within the past 50
               years, the tax assessors-collectors of the taxing jurisdictions in which the
               land is located shall provide the School Land Board with a sworn
               certificate stating that, to the best of their knowledge, all taxes have been
               paid for the past 50 years and there are no outstanding taxes nor interest or
               penalties currently due against the property.
     (b) The applicant for the patent must submit to the School Land Board certified copies of
his chain of title and a survey of the land for which a patent is sought, if requested to do so by the
board.  The board shall determine the qualifications of the applicant to receive a patent under this
section.  On a finding by the board that the applicant meets the requirements of Subsection (a) of
this section, the commissioner of the General Land Office shall award the applicant a patent.  If
the applicant is denied a patent, he may file suit against the board in a district court of the county
in which the land is situated within 60 days from the date of the denial of the patent under this
section.  The trial shall be de novo and not subject to the Administrative Procedure and Texas
Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), and the burden of proof is on the
applicant.

not be used by an applicant to resolve a boundary dispute.  This section does not apply to land
that, pursuant to an action filed previous to the date of an application for patent thereon, was
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be state owned or to land on which the state has
given a mineral lease that is in effect on the date of an application for patent thereon.  A patent
under this section for land within five miles of mineral production shall reserve minerals to the
state in the same manner provided by law for reservations of minerals in sales to good faith
claimants of unsurveyed school land within five miles of production.

same duties and powers that said Commissioner would have if present.
     The Veterans' Land Board may provide for, issue and sell not to exceed Nine Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($950,000,000) in bonds or obligations of the State of Texas for the
purpose of creating a fund to be known as the Veterans' Land Fund , Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($700,000,000) of which have heretofore been authorized.  Such bonds or obligations
shall be sold for not less than par value and accrued interest;  shall be issued in such forms,
denominations, and upon such terms as are now or may hereafter be provided by law; shall be
issued and sold at such times, at such places, and in such installments as may be determined by
said Board; and shall bear a rate or rates of interest as may be fixed by said Board but the
weighted average annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and
understood in the municipal bond market, of all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of
any bonds may not exceed the rate specified in Section 65 of this Article.  All bonds or
obligations issued and sold hereunder shall, after execution by the Board, approval by the
Attorney General of Texas, registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of
Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general
obligations of the State of Texas under the Constitution of Texas; and all bonds heretofore issued
and sold by said Board are hereby in all respects validated and declared to be general obligations
of the State of Texas.  In order to prevent default in the payment of principal or interest on any
such bonds, the Legislature shall appropriate a sufficient amount to pay the same.
     In the sale of any such bonds or obligations, a preferential right of purchase shall be given
to the administrators of the various Teacher Retirement Funds, the Permanent University Funds,
and the Permanent School Funds.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund shall consist of any lands heretofore or hereafter purchased by
said Board, until the sale price therefor, together with any interest and penalties due, have been
received by said Board (although nothing herein shall be construed to prevent said Board from
accepting full payment for a portion of any tract), and of the moneys attributable to any bonds
heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board which moneys so attributable shall include
but shall not be limited to the proceeds from the issuance and sale of such bonds;  the moneys
received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with such proceeds;  the
moneys received from the sale or resale of any lands, or rights therein, purchased with other
moneys attributable to such bonds;  the interest and penalties received from the sale or resale of
such lands, or rights therein;  the bonuses, income, rents, royalties, and any other pecuniary
benefit received by said Board from any such lands;  sums received by way of indemnity or
forfeiture for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any such bonds to comply with his bid
and accept and pay for such bonds or for the failure of any bidder for the purchase of any lands
comprising a part of said Fund to comply with his bid and accept and pay for any such lands; and
interest received from investments of any such moneys.  The principal and interest on the bonds
heretofore and hereafter issued by said Board shall be paid out of the moneys of said Fund in
conformance with the Constitutional provisions authorizing such bonds; but the moneys of said
Fund which are not immediately committed to the payment of principal and interest on such
bonds, the purchase of lands as herein provided, or the payment of expenses as herein provided
may be invested as authorized by law until such moneys are needed for such purposes.
     All moneys comprising a part of said Fund and not expended for the purposes herein
provided shall be a part of said Fund until there are sufficient moneys therein to retire fully all of
the bonds heretofore or hereafter issued and sold by said Board, at which time all such moneys
remaining in said Fund, except such portion thereof as may be necessary to retire all such bonds
which portion shall be set aside and retained in said Fund for the purpose of retiring all such
bonds, shall be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund to be appropriated to such
purposes as may be prescribed by law.  All moneys becoming a part of said Fund thereafter shall
likewise be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
     When a Division of said Fund (each Division consisting of the moneys attributable to the
bonds issued and sold pursuant to a single Constitutional authorization and the lands purchased
therewith) contains sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds secured by such Division, the
moneys thereof, except such portion as may be needed to retire all of the bonds secured by such
Division which portion shall be set aside and remain a part of such Division for the purpose of
retiring all such bonds, may be used for the purpose of paying the principal and the interest
thereon, together with the expenses herein authorized, of any other bonds heretofore or hereafter
issued and sold by said Board.  Such use shall be a matter for the discretion and direction of said
Board; but there may be no such use of any such moneys contrary to the rights of any holder of
any of the bonds issued and sold by said Board or violative of any contract to which said Board is
a party.
     The Veterans' Land Fund shall be used by said Board for the purpose of purchasing lands
situated in the State of Texas owned by the United States or any governmental agency thereof,
owned by the Texas Prison System or any other governmental agency of the State of Texas, or
owned by any person, firm, or corporation.  All lands thus purchased shall be acquired at the
lowest price obtainable, to be paid for in cash, and shall be a part of said Fund.  Such lands
heretofore or hereafter purchased and comprising a part of said Fund are hereby declared to be
held for a governmental purpose, although the individual purchasers thereof shall be subject to
taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as are purchasers of lands dedicated to the
Permanent Free Public School Fund.
     The lands of the Veterans' Land Fund shall be sold by said Board in such quantities, on
such terms, at such prices, at such rates of interest and under such rules and regulations as are
now or may hereafter be provided by law to veterans, as they are now or may hereafter be defined
by the laws of the State of Texas.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any lands in the Veterans'
Land Fund which have been first offered for sale to veterans and which have not been sold may
be sold or resold to such purchasers, in such quantities, and on such terms, and at such prices and
rates of interest, and under such rules and regulations as are now or may hereafter be provided by
law.
     Said Veterans' Land Fund, to the extent of the  attributable to any bonds hereafter issued
and sold by said Board may be used by said Board, as is now or may hereafter be provided by
law, for the purpose of paying the expenses of surveying, monumenting, road construction, legal
fees, recordation fees, advertising and other like costs necessary or incidental to the purchase and
sale, or resale, of any lands purchased with any of the moneys attributable to such additional
bonds, such expenses to be added to the price of such lands when sold, or resold, by said Board; 
for the purpose of paying the expenses of issuing, selling, and delivering any such additional
bonds; and for the purpose of meeting the expenses of paying the interest or principal due or to
become due on any such additional bonds.
     All of the moneys attributable to any series of bonds hereafter issued and sold by said
Board (a "series of bonds" being all of the bonds issued and sold in a single transaction as a
single installment of bonds) may be used for the purchase of lands as herein provided, to be sold
as herein provided, for a period ending eight (8) years after the date of sale of such series of
bonds;  provided, however, that so much of such moneys as may be necessary to pay interest on
bonds hereafter issued and sold shall be set aside for that purpose in accordance with the
resolution adopted by said Board authorizing the issuance and sale of such series of bonds.  After
such eight (8) year period, all of such moneys shall be set aside for the retirement of any bonds
hereafter issued and sold and to pay interest thereon, together with any expenses as provided
herein, in accordance with the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance and sale of such
additional bonds, until there are sufficient moneys to retire all of the bonds hereafter issued and
sold, at which time all such moneys then remaining a part of said Veterans' Land Fund and
thereafter becoming a part of said Fund shall be governed as elsewhere provided herein.
     This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Land Program, there is hereby reposed in the
Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this Amendment,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the
Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.
     Should the Legislature enact any enabling laws in anticipation of this Amendment, no
such law shall be void by reason of its anticipatory nature.

Sec. 1.  EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY; TAX IN PROPORTION TO VALUE; INCOME
TAX; EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM AD
VALOREM TAXATION.  (a) Taxation shall be equal and uniform.
     (b) All real property and tangible personal property in this State, unless exempt as
required or permitted by this Constitution, whether owned by natural persons or corporations,
other than municipal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value, which shall be ascertained as may
be provided by law.
     (c) The Legislature may provide for the taxation of intangible property and may also
impose occupation taxes, both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal,
doing any business in this State.  It may also tax incomes of both natural persons and
corporations other than municipal, except that persons engaged in mechanical and agricultural
pursuits shall never be required to pay an occupation tax.
     (d) The Legislature by general law shall exempt from ad valorem taxation household
goods not held or used for the production of income and personal effects not held or used for the

                    (1) all or part of the personal property homestead of a family or single adult,
          "personal property homestead" meaning that personal property exempt by law
          from forced sale for debt;

may provide for the taxation of all property exempt under a law adopted under Subdivision (2) of
Subsection (d) of this section and not exempt from ad valorem taxation by any other law.  In the
manner provided by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that
purpose may provide for the taxation of all property exempt under a law adopted under
Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section and not exempt from ad valorem taxation by any
other law.

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) The governing body of any county, city, town, school district, or other political
subdivision of the State, other than a county education district, may exempt by its own action not
less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of
persons, married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for
purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of
age or older, including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the
political subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent
(20%) of the voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the
governing body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an
amount not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market
value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or
over shall be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  In the
manner provided by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that
purpose may exempt an amount not less the Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000), as provided in the
petition, of the market value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty-five
(65) years of age or over from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the county education district. 
An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both
exemptions from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the
subdivision has adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the
payment of any debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to
continue to levy and collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so
pledged until the debt is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of
the contract by which the debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based
on assessed value is increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to
market value, provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall
be rounded to the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($5,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  In addition to this exemption, the
legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is disabled as described in
Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older from ad
valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature
by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional exemption
authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years of age or
older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older
may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An eligible
person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all residence
homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but the
legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1-d-1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law.  
However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of
the homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply
with governmental requirements.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may exempt from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence
homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  In the manner provided
by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that purpose may exempt
from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a
married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed twenty
percent.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized pursuant to this subsection may not
be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the legislature by general law prescribes
other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption.  An eligible adult is entitled to
receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad valorem tax has previously been
pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a political subdivision may continue to
levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads exempted under this subsection until
the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by
which the debt was created.  The legislature by general law may prescribe procedures for the
administration of residence homestead exemptions.

out of the money of the Veterans' Land Fund, but the money in the fund that is not immediately
committed to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds, the purchase of lands, or the

Fund II.  Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II is a separate and distinct fund from the Veterans'

the payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds, including payments by
the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal of or interest on the
bonds authorized by this section or by Section 49-b or Section 49-b-1 of this article or otherwise
authorized by this constitution to be issued by the Board to provide money for the fund, may be
used by the Board, to an extent not inconsistent with proceedings authorizing the bonds to:
                    (1) make temporary transfers to another of those funds to avoid temporary cash
          deficiency in that fund or make a transfer to another of those funds for the
          purposes of that fund;
                    (2) pay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued to provide
          money for another of those funds to make bond enhancement payments with
          respect to the bonds; or
                    (3) pay the principal of or interest on revenue bonds of the Board or make bond
          enhancement payments with respect to the bonds if the bonds are issued to
          provide funds to purchase lands and sell lands to veterans or make home mortgage
          loans to veterans.
     (l) If the Board determines that assets from the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund, or the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II are not required for the
purposes of the fund, the Board may transfer the assets to another of those funds or use the assets
to secure revenue bonds issued by the Board under this section.
     (m) The revenue bonds shall be special obligations of the Board and payable only from
and secured only by receipts of the funds, assets transferred from the funds, and other revenues
and assets as determined by the Board and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the
Veterans' Land Board.  The Board may issue revenue bonds from time to time, which bonds may
not exceed an aggregate principal amount that the Board determines can be fully retired from the
receipts of the funds, the assets transferred from the funds, and the other revenues and assets
pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds.  The revenue bonds shall be issued and sold in
forms and denomination, in the manner, on terms, at times and places, and in installments the
Board determines.  Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified by any other provision of this
constitution, the revenue bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Board determines.  A
determination made by the Board under this subsection shall be binding and conclusive as to the
matter determined.
     (n) Notwithstanding any provisions of Section 49-b or 49-b-1 of this article to the
contrary, the bonds authorized to be issued and sold by the Veterans' Land Board by this section
or by Sections 49-b and 49-b-1 of this article shall be issued and sold in forms and
denominations, on terms, at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments the Board
determines.  The bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Board determines.  The bonds
shall be incontestable after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of Texas,
and delivery to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds.
     (o) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program and the Veterans' Land
Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the
design and objects of this Amendment, including the power to delegate such duties,
responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.
     (p) In this section, "veteran" has the meaning assigned by Section 49-b-1 of this article.

     (e) Each governing board authorized to participate in the distribution of money under this

     (i) The legislature by general law may dedicate portions of the state's revenues to the
creation of a dedicated fund ("the higher education fund") for the purposes expressed in
Subsection (a) of this section.  The legislature shall provide for administration of the fund, which
shall be invested in the manner provided for investment of the permanent university fund.  The
income from the investment of the higher education fund shall be credited to the higher education
fund until such time as the fund totals $2 billion.  The principal of the higher education fund shall
never be expended.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund reaches $2 billion, as
certified by the comptroller of public accounts, the dedication of general revenue funds provided
for in Subsection (a) of this section shall cease.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund
reaches $2 billion, and each year thereafter, 10 percent of the interest, dividends, and other
income accruing from the investments of the higher education fund during the previous fiscal
year shall be deposited and become part of the principal of the fund, and out of the remainder of
the annual income from the investment of the principal of the fund there shall be appropriated an
annual sum sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds and notes issued under
this section and the balance of the income shall be allocated, distributed, and expended as
provided for the appropriations made under Subsection (a).
     (j) The state systems and institutions of higher education designated in this section may
not receive any additional funds from the general revenue of the state for acquiring land with or
without permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other permanent
improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other permanent
improvements except that:
                    (1) in the case of fire or natural disaster the legislature may appropriate from the
          general revenue an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss of any building
          or other permanent improvement; and
                    (2) the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may, in cases of
          demonstrated need, which need must be clearly expressed in the body of the act,
          appropriate additional general revenue funds for acquiring land with or without
          permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other
          permanent improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or
          other permanent improvements.
This subsection does not apply to legislative appropriations made prior to the adoption of this
amendment.
     (k) Without the prior approval of the legislature, appropriations under this section may
not be expended for acquiring land with or without permanent improvements, or for constructing
and equipping buildings or other permanent improvements, for a branch campus or educational
center that is not a separate degree granting institution created by general law.
     (l) This section is self enacting upon the issuance of the governor's proclamation
declaring the adoption of the amendment, and the state comptroller of public accounts and the
state treasurer shall do all things necessary to effectuate this section.  This section does not
impair any obligation created by the issuance of any bonds and notes in accordance with prior
law, and all outstanding bonds and notes shall be paid in full, both principal and interest, in
accordance with their terms.  If the provisions of this section conflict with any other provisions of
this constitution, then the provisions of this section shall prevail, notwithstanding all such

Sec. 24.  PERSONAL INCOME TAX; DEDICATION OF PROCEEDS.  (a) A general law
enacted by the legislature that imposes a tax on the net incomes of natural persons, including a
person's share of partnership and unincorporated association income, must provide that the
portion of the law imposing the tax not take effect until approved by a majority of the registered
voters voting in a statewide referendum held on the question of imposing the tax.  The
referendum must specify the rate of the tax that will apply to taxable income as defined by law.
(b) A general law enacted by the legislature that increases the rate of the tax, or changes the tax,
in a manner that results in an increase in the combined income tax liability of all persons subject
to the tax may not take effect until approved by a majority of the registered voters voting in a
statewide referendum held on the question of increasing the income tax.  A determination of
whether a bill proposing a change in the tax would increase the combined income tax liability of
all persons subject to the tax must be made by comparing the provisions of the proposed change
in law with the provisions of the law for the most recent year in which actual tax collections have
been made.  A referendum held under this subsection must specify the manner in which the
proposed law would increase the combined income tax liability of all persons subject to the tax.
(c) Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, the legislature may amend or repeal a
tax approved by the voters under this section without submitting the amendment or the repeal to
the voters as provided by Subsection (a) of this section.
(d) If the legislature repeals a tax approved by the voters under this section, the legislature may
reenact the tax without submitting the reenactment to the voters as provided by Subsection (a) of
this section only if the effective date of the reenactment of the tax is before the first anniversary
of the effective date of the repeal.
(e) The legislature may provide for the taxation of income in a manner which is consistent with
federal law.
(f) In the first year in which a tax described by Subsection (a) is imposed and during the first year
of any increase in the tax that is subject to Subsection (b) of this section, not less than two thirds
of all net revenues remaining after payment of all refunds allowed by law and expenses of
collection from the tax shall be used to reduce the rate of ad valorem maintenance and operation
taxes levied for the support of primary and secondary public education.  In subsequent years, not
less than two thirds of all net revenues from the tax shall be used to continue such ad valorem tax
relief.
(g) The net revenues remaining after the dedication of money from the tax under Subsection (f)
of this section shall be used for support of education, subject to legislative appropriation,
allocation, and direction.
(h) The maximum rate at which a school district may impose ad valorem maintenance and
operation taxes is reduced by an amount equal to one cent per $100 valuation for each one cent
per $100 valuation that the school district's ad valorem maintenance and operation tax is reduced
by the minimum amount of money dedicated under Subsection (f) of this section, provided that a
school district may subsequently increase the maximum ad valorem maintenance and operation
tax rate if the increased maximum rate is approved by a majority of the voters of the school
district voting at an election called and held for that purpose.  The legislature by general law shall
provide for the tax relief that is required by Subsection (f) and this subsection.
(i) Subsections (f) and (h) of this section apply to ad valorem maintenance and operation taxes
levied by a school district on or after the first January 1 after the date on which a tax on the net
incomes of natural persons, including a person's share of partnership and unincorporated
association income, begins to apply to that income, except that if the income tax begins to apply
on a January 1, Subsections (f) and (h) of this section apply to ad valorem maintenance and
operation taxes levied on or after that date.

this Constitution to the extent of the conflict.  (Added Nov. 2, 1993.)

shall order the ballot at the election to be printed to provide for voting for or against the
proposition:  "Abolishing the office of county surveyor."   Each qualified voter of the county is
entitled to vote in the election.  If the office of County Surveyor is abolished under this

          retirement and related disability and death benefits for public employees and
          officers.  Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles.  The
          assets of a system are held in trust for the benefit of members and may not be
          diverted.
                    (2) A person may not receive benefits from more than one system for the same
          service, but the legislature may provide by law that a person with service covered
          by more than one system or program is entitled to a fractional benefit from each
          system or program based on service rendered under each system or program
          calculated as to amount upon the benefit formula used in that system or program. 
          Transfer of service credit between the Employees Retirement System of Texas
          and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas also may be authorized by law.
                    (3) Each statewide benefit system must have a board of trustees to administer the
          system and to invest the funds of the system in such securities as the board may
          consider prudent investments.  In making investments, a board shall exercise the
          judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of
          ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of
          their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent
          disposition of their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as
          the probable safety of their capital.  The legislature by law may further restrict the
          investment discretion of a board.
                    (4) General laws establishing retirement systems and optional retirement programs
          for public employees and officers in effect at the time of the adoption of this
          section remain in effect, subject to the general powers of the legislature
          established in this subsection.
     (b) State Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall establish by law a Teacher Retirement System of Texas
          to provide benefits for persons employed in the public schools, colleges, and
          universities supported wholly or partly by the state.  Other employees may be
          included under the system by law.
                    (2) The legislature shall establish by law an Employees Retirement System of
          Texas to provide benefits for officers and employees of the state and such state
          compensated officers and employees of appellate courts and judicial districts as
          may be included under the system by law.
                    (3) The amount contributed by a person participating in the Employees Retirement
          System of Texas or the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall be established
          by the legislature but may not be less than six percent of current compensation. 
          The amount contributed by the state may not be less than six percent nor more
          than 10 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to individuals participating in
          the system.  In an emergency, as determined by the governor, the legislature may
          appropriate such additional sums as are actuarially determined to be required to
          fund benefits authorized by law.
     (c) Local Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall provide by law for:
                              (A) the creation by any city or county of a system of benefits for its
               officers and employees;
                              (B) a statewide system of benefits for the officers and employees of
               counties or other political subdivisions of the state in which counties or
               other political subdivisions may voluntarily participate; and
                              (C) a statewide system of benefits for officers and employees of cities in
               which cities may voluntarily participate.
                    (2) Benefits under these systems must be reasonably related to participant tenure
          and contributions.
          (d) Judicial Retirement System.
                     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the system of retirement,
          disability, and survivors' benefits heretofore established in the constitution or by
          law for justices, judges, and commissioners of the appellate courts and judges of
          the district and criminal district courts is continued in effect.  Contributions
          required and benefits payable are to be as provided by law.
                    (2) General administration of the Judicial Retirement System of Texas is by the
          Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas under such
          regulations as may be provided by law.
     (e) Anticipatory Legislation.  Legislation enacted in anticipation of this amendment is not
void because it is anticipatory.
     (f) Retirement Systems Not Belonging to a Statewide System.  The board of trustees of a
system or program that provides retirement and related disability and death benefits for public
officers and employees and that does not participate in a statewide public retirement system shall:
                    (1) administer the system or program of benefits;
                    (2) hold the assets of the system or program for the exclusive purposes of
          providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable
          expenses of administering the system or program; and
                    (3) select legal counsel and an actuary and adopt sound actuarial assumptions to
          be used by the system or program.

Development Bonds," shall be executed in such form, denominations, and upon such terms as
may be prescribed by law, provided, however, that the bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest
as may be fixed by the Parks and Wildlife Department or its successor, but the weighted average
annual interest rate, as that phrase is commonly and ordinarily used and understood in the
municipal bond market, or all the bonds issued and sold in any installment of any bonds shall not

installments as said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its successor, finds feasible and practical
in accomplishing the purpose set forth herein.

     While any of the bonds, or any interest on any such bonds, is outstanding and unpaid,
there is hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the Treasury in each fiscal year,
not otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay the
principal and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such fiscal year, less the
amount in the interest and sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year, which includes any
receipts derived during the prior fiscal year by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said
successor, from admission charges to State Parks, as the Legislature may prescribe by general
law.
     The Legislature may provide for the investment of moneys available in the Texas Park
Development Fund and the interest and sinking fund established for the payment of bonds issued
by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor.  Income from such investment shall
be used for the purposes prescribed by the Legislature.
     From the moneys received by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor,
from the sale of the bonds issued hereunder, there shall be deposited in the interest and sinking
fund for the bonds authorized by this section sufficient moneys to pay the interest to become due
during the State fiscal year in which the bonds were issued.  After all bonds have been fully paid
with interest, or after there are on deposit in the interest and sinking fund sufficient moneys to
pay all future maturities of principal and interest, additional moneys received from admission
charges to State Parks shall be deposited to the State Parks Fund, or any successor fund which
may be established by the Legislature as a depository for Park revenue earned by said Parks and
Wildlife Department, or its said successor.
     All bonds issued hereunder shall after approval by the Attorney General, registration by
the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchasers, be

[NOTE: Two different Sections 49-g of Article III were adopted in 1988]

[First Section 49-g.] 

Sec. 49 g.  ECONOMIC STABILIZATION FUND.  (Text of section as added by Acts 1987,
70th Leg., R.S., H.J.R. 2.)  (a) The economic stabilization fund is established as a special fund in
the state treasury.
(b) The comptroller shall, not later than the 90th day of each biennium, transfer to the economic
stabilization fund one half of any unencumbered positive balance of general revenues on the last
day of the preceding biennium.  If necessary, the comptroller shall reduce the amount transferred
in proportion to the other amounts prescribed by this section to prevent the amount in the fund
from exceeding the limit in effect for that biennium under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (c) Not later than the 90th day of each fiscal year, the comptroller of public accounts shall
transfer from general revenue to the economic stabilization fund the amounts prescribed by
Subsections (d) and (e) of this section.  However, if necessary, the comptroller shall reduce
proportionately the amounts transferred to prevent the amount in the fund from exceeding the
limit in effect for that biennium under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (d) If in the preceding year the state received from oil production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of oil production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  In computing the net amount of oil
production taxes received, the comptroller may not consider refunds paid as a result of oil
overcharge litigation.
     (e) If in the preceding year the state received from gas production taxes a net amount
greater than the net amount of gas production taxes received by the state in the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1987, the comptroller shall transfer to the economic stabilization fund an amount
equal to 75 percent of the difference between those amounts.  The comptroller shall retain the
remaining 25 percent of the difference as general revenue.  For the purposes of this subsection,
the comptroller shall adjust his computation of revenues to reflect only 12 months of collection.
     (f) The legislature may appropriate additional amounts to the economic stabilization fund.
     (g) During each fiscal biennium, the amount in the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount, excluding investment income, interest
income, and amounts borrowed from special funds, deposited in general revenue during the
preceding biennium.
     (h) In preparing an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium as required
by Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution, the comptroller shall estimate the amount of the
transfers that will be made under Subsections (b), (d), and (e) of this section.  The comptroller
shall deduct that amount from the estimate of anticipated revenues as if the transfers were made
on August 31 of that fiscal year.
     (i) The comptroller shall credit to general revenue interest due to the economic
stabilization fund that would result in an amount in the economic stabilization fund that exceeds
the limit in effect under Subsection (g) of this section.
     (j) The comptroller may transfer money from the economic stabilization fund to general
revenue to prevent or eliminate a temporary cash deficiency in general revenue.  The comptroller
shall return the amount transferred to the economic stabilization fund as soon as practicable, but
not later than August 31 of each odd numbered year.  The comptroller shall allocate the
depository interest as if the transfers had not been made.  If the comptroller submits a statement
to the governor and the legislature under Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution when money
from the economic stabilization fund is in general revenue, the comptroller shall state that the
transferred money is not available for appropriation from general revenue.
     (k) Amounts from the economic stabilization fund may be appropriated during a regular
legislative session only for a purpose for which an appropriation from general revenue was made
by the preceding legislature and may be appropriated in a special session only for a purpose for
which an appropriation from general revenue was made in a preceding legislative session of the
same legislature.  An appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may be made only if the
comptroller certifies that appropriations from general revenue made by the preceding legislature
for the current biennium exceed available general revenues and cash balances for the remainder
of that biennium.  The amount of an appropriation from the economic stabilization fund may not
exceed the difference between the comptroller's estimate of general revenue for the current
biennium at the time the comptroller receives for certification the bill making the appropriation
and the amount of general revenue appropriations for that biennium previously certified by the
comptroller.  Appropriations from the economic stabilization fund under this subsection may not
extend beyond the last day of the current biennium.  An appropriation from the economic
stabilization fund must be approved by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house
of the legislature.
     (l) If an estimate of anticipated revenues for a succeeding biennium prepared by the
comptroller pursuant to Article III, Section 49a, of this constitution is less than the revenues that
are estimated at the same time by the comptroller to be available for the current biennium, the
legislature may, by a three fifths vote of the members present in each house, appropriate for the
succeeding biennium from the economic stabilization fund an amount not to exceed this
difference.  Following each fiscal year, the actual amount of revenue shall be computed, and if
the estimated difference exceeds the actual difference, the comptroller shall transfer the amount
necessary from general revenue to the economic stabilization fund so that the actual difference
shall not be exceeded.  If all or a portion of the difference in revenue from one biennium to the
next results, at least in part, from a change in a tax rate or base adopted by the legislature, the
computation of revenue difference shall be adjusted to the amount that would have been
available had the rate or base not been changed.
     (m) In addition to the appropriation authority provided by Subsections (k) and (l) of this
section, the legislature may, by a two thirds vote of the members present in each house,
appropriate amounts from the economic stabilization fund at any time and for any purpose.
     (n) Money appropriated from the economic stabilization fund is subject to being withheld
or transferred, within any limits provided by statute, by any person or entity authorized to
exercise the power granted by Article XVI, Section 69, of this constitution.
     (o) In this section, "net" means the amount of money that is equal to the difference
between gross collections and refunds before the comptroller allocates the receipts as provided
by law.  (Added Nov. 8, 1988.)

constitution, the amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds that mature or
become due during the fiscal year, less any amount in the interest and sinking account at the end
of the preceding fiscal year that is pledged to the payment of the bonds or interest.
     (c) The legislature may require review or approval of the issuance of the bonds, of the use
of the bond proceeds, or of the rules adopted by an agency to govern the use of the bond
proceeds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, any entity created or directed
to conduct this review and approval may include members, or appointees of members, of the
executive, legislative, and judicial departments of state government. 
     (d) Should the legislature enact enabling laws in anticipation of the adoption of this
section, such acts shall not be void by reason of their anticipatory character.

mature serially or otherwise in not more than 10 years from their respective dates.  All bonds
issued under this section shall be sold only through competitive bidding and are subject to

The permanent university fund may be invested in the bonds and notes issued under this section.
     (f) The funds appropriated by this section may not be used for the purpose of
constructing, equipping, repairing, or rehabilitating buildings or other permanent improvements

     (i) The legislature by general law may dedicate portions of the state's revenues to the
creation of a dedicated fund ("the higher education fund") for the purposes expressed in
Subsection (a) of this section.  The legislature shall provide for administration of the fund, which
shall be invested in the manner provided for investment of the permanent university fund.  The
income from the investment of the higher education fund shall be credited to the higher education
fund until such time as the fund totals $2 billion.  The principal of the higher education fund shall
never be expended.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund reaches $2 billion, as
certified by the comptroller of public accounts, the dedication of general revenue funds provided
for in Subsection (a) of this section shall cease.  At the beginning of the fiscal year after the fund
reaches $2 billion, and each year thereafter, 10 percent of the interest, dividends, and other
income accruing from the investments of the higher education fund during the previous fiscal
year shall be deposited and become part of the principal of the fund, and out of the remainder of
the annual income from the investment of the principal of the fund there shall be appropriated an
annual sum sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds and notes issued under
this section and the balance of the income shall be allocated, distributed, and expended as
provided for the appropriations made under Subsection (a).
     (j) The state systems and institutions of higher education designated in this section may
not receive any additional funds from the general revenue of the state for acquiring land with or
without permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other permanent
improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other permanent
improvements except that:
                    (1) in the case of fire or natural disaster the legislature may appropriate from the
          general revenue an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss of any building
          or other permanent improvement; and
                    (2) the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may, in cases of
          demonstrated need, which need must be clearly expressed in the body of the act,
          appropriate additional general revenue funds for acquiring land with or without
          permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other
          permanent improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or
          other permanent improvements.
This subsection does not apply to legislative appropriations made prior to the adoption of this
amendment.
     (k) Without the prior approval of the legislature, appropriations under this section may
not be expended for acquiring land with or without permanent improvements, or for constructing
and equipping buildings or other permanent improvements, for a branch campus or educational
center that is not a separate degree granting institution created by general law.
     (l) This section is self enacting upon the issuance of the governor's proclamation
declaring the adoption of the amendment, and the state comptroller of public accounts shall do all
things necessary to effectuate this section.  This section does not impair any obligation created by
the issuance of any bonds and notes in accordance with prior law, and all outstanding bonds and
notes shall be paid in full, both principal and interest, in accordance with their terms.  If the
provisions of this section conflict with any other provisions of this constitution, then the
provisions of this section shall prevail, notwithstanding all such conflicting provisions.

Sec. 1.  EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY; TAX IN PROPORTION TO VALUE; INCOME
TAX; EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM AD
VALOREM TAXATION.  (a) Taxation shall be equal and uniform.
     (b) All real property and tangible personal property in this State, unless exempt as
required or permitted by this Constitution, whether owned by natural persons or corporations,
other than municipal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value, which shall be ascertained as may
be provided by law.
     (c) The Legislature may provide for the taxation of intangible property and may also
impose occupation taxes, both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal,
doing any business in this State.  Subject to the restrictions of Section 24 of this article, it may

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) The governing body of any county, city, town, school district, or other political
subdivision of the State, other than a county education district, may exempt by its own action not
less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of
persons, married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for
purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of
age or older, including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the
political subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent
(20%) of the voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the
governing body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an
amount not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market
value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or
over shall be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  In the
manner provided by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that
purpose may exempt an amount not less the Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000), as provided in the
petition, of the market value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty-five
(65) years of age or over from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the county education district. 
An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both
exemptions from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the
subdivision has adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the
payment of any debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to
continue to levy and collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so
pledged until the debt is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of
the contract by which the debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based
on assessed value is increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to
market value, provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall
be rounded to the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($5,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  In addition to this exemption, the
legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is disabled as described in
Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older from ad
valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature
by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional exemption
authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years of age or
older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older
may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An eligible
person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all residence
homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but the
legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1-d-1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law.  
However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of
the homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply
with governmental requirements.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may exempt from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence
homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  In the manner provided
by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that purpose may exempt
from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a
married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed twenty
percent.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized pursuant to this subsection may not
be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the legislature by general law prescribes
other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption.  An eligible adult is entitled to
receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad valorem tax has previously been
pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a political subdivision may continue to
levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads exempted under this subsection until
the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by
which the debt was created.  The legislature by general law may prescribe procedures for the
administration of residence homestead exemptions.
     (e 1) (Added Nov. 3, 1981; expired Jan. 2, 1982.)
     (f) The surviving spouse of a person who received an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section for the residence homestead of a person sixty five (65) years of age or older is
entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same political subdivision in an amount
equal to that of the exemption received by the deceased spouse if the deceased spouse died in a
year in which the deceased spouse received the exemption, the surviving spouse was fifty five
(55) years of age or older when the deceased spouse died, and the property was the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse.  A person who receives an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section is not entitled to an exemption under this subsection.  The legislature by general law
may prescribe procedures for the administration of this subsection.

laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes; actual places of religious
worship, also any property owned by a church or by a strictly religious society for the exclusive

a veteran of the armed services of the United States who is classified as disabled by the Veterans'
Administration or by a successor to that agency; or the military service in which he served.  A
veteran who is certified as having a disability of less than 10 percent is not entitled to an
exemption.  A veteran having a disability rating of not less than 10 percent nor more than 30

                    (2) "Fund" means the Texas growth fund.
                    (3) "Venture capital investment" means an investment in debt, equity, or a
          combination of debt and equity that possesses the potential for substantial
          investment returns, and includes investments in new or small businesses,
          investments in businesses with rapid growth potential, or investments in applied
          research and organizational activities leading to business formation and
          opportunities involving new or improved processes or products.
     (b) The Texas growth fund is created as a trust fund.  Except as otherwise provided by
this section, the fund is subject to the general laws of this state governing private sector trusts. 
The governing boards of the permanent university fund, the permanent school fund, the Teacher
Retirement System of Texas, the Employees Retirement System of Texas, and any other pension
system created under this constitution or by statute of this state in their sole discretion may make
investments in the fund.
     (c) The fund is managed by a board of trustees consisting of four public members
appointed by the governor and one member from and elected by the membership of each of the
following:
                    (1) the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System;
                    (2) the Board of Regents of The Texas A&M University System;
                    (3)  the Board of Trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas;
                    (4) the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas; and
                    (5) the State Board of Education.
     (d) Each public member of the board must have demonstrated substantial investment
expertise.  A public member serves for a six year term expiring February 1 of an odd numbered
year.
     (e) A person filling an elected position on the board of trustees ceases to be a member of
the board of trustees when the person ceases to be a member of the board the person represents or
as otherwise provided by procedures adopted by the board the person represents.  The governor
shall designate a chairman from among the members of the board of trustees who serves a term
of two years expiring February 1 of each odd numbered year.  A member may serve more than
one term as chairman.
     (f) The board of trustees shall manage the investment of the fund, and may:
                    (1) employ and retain staff, including a chief executive officer;
                    (2) analyze and structure investments;

                    (8) alternatively, or in combination with its own staff, contract for the
          management of investments under this section with a private investment
          management firm or with an investing fund or system electing a member of the
          board of trustees.
     (g) In making investments, including venture capital investments, the board of trustees
shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of
ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering
the probable income as well as the probable safety of the capital of the fund.  All investments of
the fund shall be directly related to the creation, retention, or expansion of employment
opportunity and economic growth in Texas.  In making venture capital investments, all other
material matters being equal, the board of trustees shall invest in technological advances that
could be expected to result in the greatest increase in employment opportunity and economic
growth in Texas.
     (h) The board of trustees shall establish and operate the fund to the extent practical under
the generally accepted business procedures relating to a mutual fund and shall value the
investments for determining the purchase or sales price of participating shares of investing funds
or systems participating in the fund consistent with investment contracts.  Evidences of
participation in the fund shall be held by the comptroller of public accounts in keeping with the
custodial responsibilities of that office.
     (i) An investing fund or system, without liability at law or in equity to members of the
governing board of the fund or system in their personal or official capacities, may cumulatively
invest in the Texas growth fund not more than one percent of the book or cost value of the
investing fund or system, as determined at the end of each fiscal year.
     (j) The board of trustees shall establish criteria for the investment of not more than 10
percent of the fund in venture capital investments.  Not more than 25 percent of the funds
available for venture capital investments may be used for unilateral investment.  Investments of
the remainder of the funds available for venture capital investments must be matched at least
equally by funds from sources other than the fund, with matching amounts established by the
board of trustees.  The board of trustees shall also establish criteria for the investment of not less
than 50 percent of the fund in equity or debt security, or a combination of equity and debt
security, for the initial construction, expansion, or modernization of business or industrial
facilities in Texas.  The board of trustees may invest in money funds whose underlying
investments are consistent and acceptable under the investment policy of the fund.
     (k) On a quarterly basis, the amount of income realized on investments under this section
shall be distributed to each of the systems and funds investing in the Texas growth fund in
proportion to the number of participating shares of each investing system and fund.  Capital
appreciation becomes a part of the corpus of the Texas growth fund and shall be distributed in
accordance with the investment contracts.
     (l) The board of trustees shall make arrangements to begin liquidation, phase out
investments, and return the principal and capital gains on investments to the investors in the fund
not later than the 10th anniversary of the date of the adoption of this section.  Except under
unusual circumstances where it may be necessary to protect investments previously made, further
investments may not be made in or by the fund after the 10th anniversary of the date of the
adoption of this section.
     (m) At the regular legislative session next preceding the 10th anniversary of the date of
the adoption of this section, the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may authorize the
creation of Texas growth fund II, which shall operate under this section and under the board of
trustees created by this section in the same manner as the Texas growth fund.  Funds in Texas
growth fund II may not be commingled with funds in the Texas growth fund.
     (n) The board of trustees may purchase liability insurance for the coverage of the trustees,
employees, and agents of the board.
     (o) The legislature shall provide by law for the periodic review of the board of trustees in
the same manner and at the same intervals as it provides for review of other state agencies,
except that the legislature shall provide that the board of trustees is not subject to abolishment as
part of the review process.
     (p) This section expires September 1, 1998, except that if the legislature authorizes the
creation of Texas growth fund II as provided by Subsection (m) of this section, this section
expires September 1, 2008.
     (q) This section is self executing and takes effect on its adoption by the voters.  All state
officials named in this section and the comptroller of public accounts shall take all necessary
actions for the implementation of this section.  The legislature shall provide by law for full
disclosure of all details concerning investments authorized by this section.
     (r) The board of trustees may not invest money from the Texas growth fund in a business
unless the business has submitted to the board of trustees an affidavit disclosing whether the
business has any direct financial investment in or with South Africa or Namibia.

Sec. 49 d 8.  TEXAS WATER DEVELOPMENT FUND II.  (a) The Texas Water Development
Fund II is created in the state treasury as a fund separate and distinct from the Texas Water
Development Fund established under Section 49 c of this article.  Money in the Texas Water
Development Fund II shall be administered without further appropriation by the Texas Water
Development Board and shall be used for any one or more of the purposes authorized by Sections
49 c, 49 d, 49 d 1, 49 d 2, 49 d 5, 49 d 6, and 49 d 7 of this article, as determined by the Texas
Water Development Board.  Separate accounts shall be established in the Texas Water
Development Fund II for administering proceedings related to the purposes described in Section
49 d of this article, the purposes described in Subsection (e) of Section 49 d 7 of this article, and
all other authorized purposes.  The Texas Water Development Board is hereby authorized, at its
determination, to issue general obligation bonds for one or more accounts of the Texas Water
Development Fund II in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of bonds authorized
pursuant to Sections 49 d 2, 49 d 6, and 49 d 7 of this article less the amount of bonds issued
pursuant to those sections to augment the Texas Water Development Fund.  Nothing in this
section, however, shall grant to the Texas Water Development Board the authority to issue bonds
under this section and under Sections 49-d-2, 49-d-6, and 49-d-7 of this article in excess of the
total amount of authorized bonds described in Sections 49-d-2, 49-d-6, and 49-d-7 of this article
or to issue bonds for purposes described in Subsection (e) of Section 49 d 7 of this article in
excess of $250 million.  The expenses of the Texas Water Development Board in connection
with the issuance of bonds for an account of the Texas Water Development Fund II and
administration of such account may be paid from money in such account.
     (b) The Texas Water Development Board is hereby authorized, at its determination, to
issue general obligation bonds for one or more accounts of the Texas Water Development Fund
II in order to refund outstanding bonds previously issued to augment the Texas Water
Development Fund, as long as the principal amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the
outstanding principal amount of the refunded bonds, and to refund the general obligation of the
State of Texas under long term contracts entered into by the Texas Water Development Board
with the United States or any of its agencies under authority granted by Section 49 d of this
article, as long as the principal amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the principal
amount of the contractual obligation of the Texas Water Development Board.  Money and assets
in the Texas Water Development Fund attributable to such refunding bonds shall be transferred
to the appropriate account of the Texas Water Development Fund II, as determined by the Texas
Water Development Board, to the extent not inconsistent with the proceedings authorizing any
outstanding bonds issued to augment the Texas Water Development Fund and the terms of any
long term contracts entered into by the Texas Water Development Board with the United States
or any of its agencies.  Further, at such time as all bonds issued to augment the Texas Water
Development Fund and all such contractual obligations have been paid or otherwise discharged,
all money and assets in the Texas Water Development Fund shall be transferred to the credit of
the Texas Water Development Fund II and deposited to the accounts therein, as determined by
the Texas Water Development Board.
     (c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 49 d of this article, the legislature shall
provide terms and conditions under which the Texas Water Development Board may sell,
transfer, or lease, in whole or in part, facilities held for the account established within the Texas
Water Development Fund II for administering proceedings related to the purposes described in
Section 49 d of this article, and the legislature may provide terms and conditions under which the
Texas Water Development Board may sell any unappropriated public waters of the state that may
be stored in such facilities.  Money received from any sale, transfer, or lease of such facilities or
water shall be credited to the account established within the Texas Water Development Fund II
for the purpose of administering proceedings related to the purposes described in Section 49 d of
this article.
     (d) Each account of the Texas Water Development Fund II shall consist of:
                    (1) the Texas Water Development Board's rights to receive repayment of financial
          assistance provided from such account, together with any evidence of such rights;
                    (2) money received from the sale or other disposition of the Texas Water
          Development Board's rights to receive repayment of such financial assistance;
                    (3) money received as repayment of such financial assistance;
                    (4) money and assets attributable to bonds issued and sold by the Texas Water
          Development Board for such account, including money and assets transferred
          from the Texas Water Development Fund pursuant to this section;
                    (5) money deposited in such account pursuant to Subsection (c) of this section;
                    (6) payments received by the Texas Water Development Board under a bond
          enhancement agreement as authorized by law with respect to bonds issued for
          such account; and
                    (7) interest and other income received from investment of money in such account.
     (e) Notwithstanding the provisions Sections 49-d-2, 49-d-6, and 49-d-7 of this article, the
principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds issued for an account of the Texas Water
Development Fund II, including payments by the Texas Water Development Board under a bond
enhancement agreement as authorized by law with respect to principal of or interest on such
bonds, shall be paid out of such account, but the money in such account that is not immediately
committed to the purposes of such account or the payment of expenses may be invested as
authorized by law until the money is needed for those purposes.  If there is not enough money in
any account available to pay the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds issued
for such account, including money to make payments by the Texas Water Development Board
under a bond enhancement agreement as authorized by law with respect to principal of or interest
on such bonds, there is appropriated out of the first money coming into the state treasury in each
fiscal year not otherwise appropriated by this constitution an amount that is sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds that mature or become due during that
fiscal year or to make bond enhancement payments with respect to those bonds.
     (f) The general obligation bonds authorized by this section may be issued as bonds, notes,
or other obligations as permitted by law and shall be sold in forms and denominations, on terms,
at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments, all as determined by the Texas Water
Development Board.  The bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Texas Water
Development Board determines.  The bonds authorized by this section shall be incontestable
after execution by the Texas Water Development Board, approval by the attorney general, and
delivery to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds.
     (g) This section being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Texas Water Development Fund II, there is hereby reposed in the
legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this section,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Texas
Water Development Board as it believes necessary.
     (h) The Texas Water Development Fund II, including any account in that fund, may not
be used to finance or aid any project that contemplates or results in the removal from the basin of
origin of any surface water necessary to supply the reasonably foreseeable future water
requirements for the next ensuing 50 year period within the river basin of origin, except on a
temporary, interim basis.

Sec. 49 j.  LIMIT ON STATE DEBT PAYABLE FROM GENERAL REVENUE FUND.  (a)
The legislature may not authorize additional state debt if the resulting annual debt service
exceeds the limitation imposed by this section.  The maximum annual debt service in any fiscal
year on state debt payable from the general revenue fund may not exceed five percent of an
amount equal to the average of the amount of general revenue fund revenues, excluding revenues
constitutionally dedicated for purposes other than payment of state debt, for the three preceding
fiscal years.
(b) For purposes of this section, "state debt payable from the general revenue fund" means
general obligation and revenue bonds, including authorized but unissued bonds, and lease
purchase agreements in an amount greater than $250,000, which bonds or lease purchase
agreements are designed to be repaid with the general revenues of the state.  The term does not
include bonds that, although backed by the full faith or credit of the state, are reasonably
expected to be paid from other revenue sources and that are not expected to create a general
revenue draw.  Bonds or lease purchase agreements that pledge the full faith and credit of the
state are considered to be reasonably expected to be paid from other revenue sources if they are
designed to receive revenues other than state general revenues sufficient to cover their debt
service over the life of the bonds or agreement.  If those bonds or agreements, or any portion of
the bonds or agreements, subsequently requires use of the state's general revenue for payment, the
bonds or agreements, or portion of the bonds or agreements, is considered to be a "state debt
payable from the general revenue fund" under this section, until:
(1) the bonds or agreements are backed by insurance or another form of guarantee that ensures
payment from a source other than general revenue; or
(2) the issuer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Bond Review Board or its successor
designated by law that the bonds no longer require payment from general revenue, and the Bond
Review Board so certifies to the Legislative Budget Board or its successor designated by law.

according to the most recent federal census, from time to time, for the convenience of the people,
shall be divided into not less than four and not more than eight precincts.  Each county in the
State with a population of 18,000 or more but less than 30,000, according to the most recent
federal census, from time to time, for the convenience of the people, shall be divided into not less
than two and not more than five precincts.  Each county in the State with a population of less
than 18,000, according to the most recent federal census, from time to time, for the convenience
of the people, shall be designated as a single precinct or, if the Commissioners Court determines
that the county needs more than one precinct, shall be divided into not more than four precincts. 
Notwithstanding the population requirements of this subsection, Chambers County, from time to
time, for the convenience of the people, shall be divided into not less than two and not more than
six precincts.  A division or designation under this subsection shall be made by the
Commissioners Court provided for by this Constitution.  Except as provided by Subsection (c) of
this section, in each such precinct there shall be elected one Justice of the Peace and one
Constable, each of whom shall hold his office for four years and until his successor shall be
elected and qualified; provided that in a county with a population of less than 150,000, according
to the most recent federal census, in any precinct in which there may be a city of 18,000 or more
inhabitants, there shall be elected two Justices of the Peace, and in a county with a population of
150,000 or more, according to the most recent federal census, each precinct may contain more
than one Justice of the Peace Court.
     (b) Each county shall, in the manner provided for justice of the peace and constable
precincts, be divided into four commissioners precincts in each of which there shall be elected by
the qualified voters thereof one County Commissioner, who shall hold his office for four years
and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.  The County Commissioners so chosen,
with the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court,
which shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this
Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.
     (c) When the boundaries of justice of the peace and constable precincts are changed, each
Justice and Constable in office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office
beginning on or after the effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct in which the
person resides for the term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in
boundaries places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or
appointed, abolishes the precinct for which he was elected or appointed, or temporarily results in
extra Justices or Constables serving in a precinct.  When, as a result of a change of precinct
boundaries, a vacancy occurs in the office of Justice of the Peace or Constable, the
Commissioners Court shall fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general election.
     (d) When the boundaries of commissioners precincts are changed, each commissioner in
office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office beginning on or after the
effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct to which each was elected or appointed
for the entire term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in boundaries
places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or appointed.
     (e) The office of Constable in Mills County is abolished.  The powers, duties, and records
of the office are transferred to the County Sheriff.
     (f) The office of Constable in Reagan County and the office of Constable in Roberts
County are abolished.  The functions of the office are transferred to the County Sheriff. 
However, the office of Constable is abolished under this subsection only if, at the statewide
election at which the constitutional amendment providing for the abolition is submitted to the
voters, a majority of the voters of Reagan County or Roberts County, as applicable, voting on the
question at that election favor the amendment.
     (g) The Legislature by general law may prescribe the qualifications of constables.

Sec. 19.  TEXAS TOMORROW FUND.  (a) The Texas tomorrow fund is created as a trust fund
dedicated to the prepayment of tuition and fees for higher education as provided by the general
laws of this state for the prepaid higher education tuition program.  The assets of the fund are
held in trust for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries and may not be diverted.  The state
shall hold the assets of the fund for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants
and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the program.
(b) Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles.  The amount contributed
by a person participating in the prepaid higher education program shall be as provided by the
general laws of this state, but may not be less than the amount anticipated for tuition and required
fees based on sound actuarial principles.  If in any fiscal year there is not enough money in the
Texas tomorrow fund to pay the tuition and required fees of an institution of higher education in
which a beneficiary enrolls or the appropriate portion of the tuition and required fees of a private
or independent institution of higher education in which a beneficiary enrolls as provided by a
prepaid tuition contract, there is appropriated out of the first money coming into the state treasury
in each fiscal year not otherwise appropriated by the constitution the amount that is sufficient to
pay the applicable amount of tuition and required fees of the institution.
(c) Assets of the fund may be invested by an entity designated by general law in securities
considered prudent investments.  Investments shall be made in the exercise of judgment and care
under the circumstances that a person of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercises
in the management of the person's affairs, not for speculation, but for the permanent disposition
of funds, considering the probable income from the disposition as well as the probable safety of
capital.

     (b) All real property and tangible personal property in this State, unless exempt as
required or permitted by this Constitution, whether owned by natural persons or corporations,
other than municipal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value, which shall be ascertained as may
be provided by law.
     (c) The Legislature may provide for the taxation of intangible property and may also
impose occupation taxes, both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal,
doing any business in this State.  Subject to the restrictions of Section 24 of this article, it may
also tax incomes of both natural persons and corporations other than municipal.  Persons engaged
in mechanical and agricultural pursuits shall never be required to pay an occupation tax.
     (d) The Legislature by general law shall exempt from ad valorem taxation household
goods not held or used for the production of income and personal effects not held or used for the
production of income.  The Legislature by general law may exempt from ad valorem taxation:
                    (1) all or part of the personal property homestead of a family or single adult,
          "personal property homestead" meaning that personal property exempt by law
          from forced sale for debt;
                    (2) subject to Subsections (e) and (g) of this section, all other tangible personal
          property, except structures which are substantially affixed to real estate and are
          used or occupied as residential dwellings and except property held or used for the
          production of income; and
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may provide for the taxation of all property exempt under a law adopted under Subdivision (2) of
Subsection (d) of this section and not exempt from ad valorem taxation by any other law.  In the
manner provided by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that
purpose may provide for the taxation of all property exempt under a law adopted under
Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section and not exempt from ad valorem taxation by any
other law.
     (f) The occupation tax levied by any county, city or town for any year on persons or
corporations pursuing any profession or business, shall not exceed one half of the tax levied by
the State for the same period on such profession or business.
     (g) The Legislature may exempt from ad valorem taxation tangible personal property that
is held or used for the production of income and has a taxable value of less than the minimum
amount sufficient to recover the costs of the administration of the taxes on the property, as
determined by or under the general law granting the exemption.
     (h) The Legislature may exempt from ad valorem taxation a mineral interest that has a
taxable value of less than the minimum amount sufficient to recover the costs of the
administration of the taxes on the interest, as determined by or under the general law granting the
exemption.
     (i) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Legislature by general law
may limit the maximum average annual percentage increase in the appraised value of residence
homesteads for ad valorem tax purposes to 10 percent, or a greater percentage, for each year
since the most recent tax appraisal.  A limitation on appraisal increases authorized by this
subsection:
          (1) takes effect as to a residence homestead on the later of the effective date of the law
     imposing the limitation or January 1 of the tax year following the first tax year the owner
     qualifies the property for an exemption under Section 1 b of this article; and
          (2) Expires on January 1 of the first tax year that neither the owner of the property when
     the limitation took effect nor the owner's spouse or surviving spouse qualifies for an

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) The governing body of any county, city, town, school district, or other political
subdivision of the State, other than a county education district, may exempt by its own action not
less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of
persons, married or unmarried, including those living alone, who are under a disability for
purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance or its successor or of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of
age or older, including those living alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the
political subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent
(20%) of the voters who voted in the last preceding election held by the political subdivision, the
governing body of the subdivision shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether an
amount not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market
value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or
over shall be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  In the
manner provided by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that
purpose may exempt an amount not less the Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000), as provided in the
petition, of the market value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of persons sixty-five
(65) years of age or over from ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the county education district. 
An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both
exemptions from the same political subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the
subdivision has adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the
payment of any debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall have authority to
continue to levy and collect the tax against the homestead property at the same rate as the tax so
pledged until the debt is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of
the contract by which the debt was created.  An exemption adopted under this subsection based
on assessed value is increased, effective January 1, 1979, to an amount that, when converted to
market value, provides the same reduction in taxes, except that the market value exemption shall
be rounded to the nearest $100.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature by general law may
provide that all or part of the exemption does not apply to a district or political subdivision that
imposes ad valorem taxes for public education purposes but is not the principal school district
providing general elementary and secondary public education throughout its territory.  In addition
to this exemption, the legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is
disabled as defined in Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty five (65) years of age or
older from ad valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes. 
The legislature by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional
exemption authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years
of age or older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age
or older may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An
eligible person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all
residence homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but
the legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1 d 1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law. 
The legislature, by general law, may provide for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a
limitation provided by this subsection for a person who qualifies for the limitation and
establishes a different residence homestead.  However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection
may be increased to the extent the value of the homestead is increased by improvements other
than repairs or improvements made to comply with governmental requirements and except as
may be consistent with the transfer of a limitation under this subsection.  For a residence
homestead subject to the limitation provided by this subsection in the 1996 tax year or an earlier
tax year, the legislature shall provide for a reduction in the amount of the limitation for the 1997
tax year and subsequent tax years in an amount equal to $10,000 multiplied by the 1997 tax rate
for general elementary and secondary public school purposes applicable to the residence
homestead.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may exempt from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence
homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  In the manner provided
by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that purpose may exempt
from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a
married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed twenty
percent.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized pursuant to this subsection may not
be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the legislature by general law prescribes
other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption.  An eligible adult is entitled to
receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad valorem tax has previously been
pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a political subdivision may continue to
levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads exempted under this subsection until
the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by
which the debt was created.  The legislature by general law may prescribe procedures for the
administration of residence homestead exemptions.

     (f) The surviving spouse of a person who received an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section for the residence homestead of a person sixty five (65) years of age or older is
entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same political subdivision in an amount
equal to that of the exemption received by the deceased spouse if the deceased spouse died in a
year in which the deceased spouse received the exemption, the surviving spouse was fifty five
(55) years of age or older when the deceased spouse died, and the property was the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse.  A person who receives an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section is not entitled to an exemption under this subsection.  The legislature by general law
may prescribe procedures for the administration of this subsection.
     (g) If the legislature provides for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a tax
limitation provided by Subsection (d) of this section for a person who qualifies for the limitation
and subsequently establishes a different residence homestead, the legislature by general law may
authorize the governing body of a school district to elect to apply the law providing for the
transfer of the tax limitation to a change of a person's residence homestead that occurred before
that law took effect, subject to any restrictions provided by general law.  The transfer of the
limitation may apply only to taxes imposed in a tax year that begins after the tax year in which
the election is made.

          INTEREST IF THE LENDER FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE LENDER'S
          OBLIGATIONS."
     If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than
English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into
the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
     (h) A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment
as to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection
(a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
                    (1) the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation
          prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an
          extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
                    (2) the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the
          payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair
          market value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
     (i) This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages
from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value
without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit
described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit
with homestead property if:
                    (1) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure
          that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by
          Section 50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
                    (2) the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the
          foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
                    (3) the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
     (j) Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e) (i) of this section are not severable, and none of
those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held
to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This
subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and
before the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e) (i) is held to be
preempted.
     (k) "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
                    (1) that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written
          agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
                    (2) that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 55 years or older;
                    (3) that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the
          spouse of each owner;
                    (4) under which advances are provided to a borrower based on the equity in a
          borrower's homestead;
                    (5) that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances
          because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
                    (6) that requires no payment of principal or interest until:
                              (A) the homestead property securing the loan is sold or otherwise
               transferred; or
                              (B)  all borrowers cease occupying the homestead property as a principal
               residence for more than 180 consecutive days and the location of the
               homestead property owner is unknown to the lender;
                    (7) that provides that if the lender fails to make loan advances as required in the
          loan documents and if the lender fails to cure the default as required in the loan
          documents, the lender forfeits all principal and interest of the reverse mortgage;
          and
                    (8) that is not made unless the owner of the homestead attests in writing that the
          owner received counseling regarding the advisability and availability of reverse
          mortgages and other financial alternatives.
     (l)  Advances made under a reverse mortgage and interest on those advances have priority
over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead
property is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of
that county.
     (m) A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and
may also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the
homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a
reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be
compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
     (n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be
made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:
                    (1) a limitation on the purpose and use of future advances or other mortgage
          proceeds;
                    (2) a limitation on future advances to a term of years or a limitation on the term of
          open end account advances;
                    (3) a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over
          intervening advances;
                    (4) a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage
          loan documents;
                    (5) a prohibition on balloon payments;
                    (6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
                    (7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest
          authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of
          interest; and
                    (8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced
          before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.
     (o) For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments,
allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means tested basis by this state, including
supplemental security income, low income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical
assistance, and general assistance:
                    (1) reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds
          from a loan and not income; and
                    (2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a
          borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
     (p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is
made must be made at regular intervals according to a plan established by the original loan
agreement.
     (q) To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section
41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on
homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit
described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent
that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner
provided for by this amendment.
     (r) The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure
proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section.
     (s) The Finance Commission of Texas shall appoint a director to conduct research on the
availability, quality, and prices of financial services and research the practices of business entities
in the state that provide financial services under this section.  The director shall collect
information and produce reports on lending activity of those making loans under this section. 
The director shall report his or her findings to the legislature not later than December 1 of each
year.

agreement with respect to principal of or interest on the bonds, shall be paid out of the money of
the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II, but the money in the fund that is not immediately
committed to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds, the making of home mortgage
loans, or the payment of expenses may be invested as authorized by law until the money is
needed for those purposes. 
(o) The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund shall consist of: 
          (1) the Board's interest in home mortgage loans the Board makes to veterans from money
     in the fund under the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program established by law; 
          (2) proceeds derived from the sale or other disposition of the Board's interest in home
     mortgage loans; 
          (3) money attributable to bonds issued and sold by the Board to provide money for the
     fund, including proceeds from the issuance and sale of bonds; 
          (4) income, rents, and other pecuniary benefits received by the Board as a result of
     making loans; 
          (5) money received by way of indemnity or forfeiture for the failure of a bidder for the
     purchase of bonds to comply with the bid and accept and pay for the bonds; 
          (6) payments received by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to
     the bonds; and 
          (7) interest received from investments of money. 
(p) The principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds for the benefit of the Veterans'
Housing Assistance Fund, including payments by the Board under a bond enhancement
agreement with respect to principal of or interest on the bonds, shall be paid out of money in the
Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund. 
(q) If there is not enough money in the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans' Housing Assistance
Fund, or the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II, as the case may be, available to pay the
principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds benefitting those funds, including money
to make payments by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal of
or interest on the bonds, there is appropriated out of the first money coming into the treasury in
each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount that is sufficient to
pay the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds that mature or become due
during that fiscal year or to make bond enhancement payments with respect to those bonds. 
(r) Receipts of all kinds of the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund, or
the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II that the Board determines are not required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds benefitting those funds,
including payments by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal
of or interest on the bonds, may be used by the Board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing the bonds to: 
          (1) make temporary transfers to another of those funds to avoid a temporary cash
     deficiency in that fund or make a transfer to another of those funds for the purposes of
     that fund; 
          (2) pay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued to provide money
     for another of those funds or make bond enhancement payments with respect to the
     bonds; or 
          (3) pay the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the Board or make bond
     enhancement payments with respect to the bonds if the bonds issued to provide funds to
     purchase lands and sell lands to veterans or to make home mortgage loans to veterans.
(s) If the Board determines that assets from the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans' Housing
Assistance Fund, or the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II are not required for the purposes of
the fund, the Board may: transfer the assets to another of those funds and use the assets to secure
revenue bonds issued by the Board; 
(t) The revenue bonds shall be special obligations of the Board and payable only from and
secured only by receipts of the funds, assets transferred from the funds, and other revenues and
assets as determined by the Board and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the
Veterans' Land Board. The Board may issue revenue bonds from time to time, which bonds may
not exceed an aggregate principal amount that the Board determines can be fully retired from the
receipts of the funds, the assets transferred from the funds, and the other revenues and assets
pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds. Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified by
any other provision of this constitution, revenue bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the
Board determines. A determination made by the Board under this subsection shall be binding and
conclusive as to the matter determined. 
(u) The bonds authorized to be issued and sold by the Veterans' Land Board shall be issued and
sold in forms and denominations, on terms, at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments
the Board determines. The bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Board determines. The
bonds shall be incontestable after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of
Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds. 
(v) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program and the Veterans' Land
Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the
design and objects of this Amendment, including the power to delegate such duties,
responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

Sec. 49 c.  TEXAS WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD; BOND ISSUE; TEXAS WATER
DEVELOPMENT FUND.  (a) The Texas Water Development Board, an agency of the State of
Texas, shall exercise such powers as necessary under this provision together with such other
duties and restrictions as may be prescribed by law.  The qualifications, compensation, and
number of members of said Board shall be determined by law.  They shall be appointed by the
Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate in the manner and for such terms as may be
prescribed by law.
(b) The Texas Water Development Board shall have the authority to provide for, issue and sell
general obligation bonds of the State of Texas as authorized by constitutional amendment or by a
debt proposition under Section 49 of this article.  The bonds shall be called "Texas Water
Development Bonds," shall be executed in such form, denominations and upon such terms as
may be prescribed by law, and may be issued in such installments as the Board finds feasible and
practical in accomplishing the purpose set forth herein.
(c) All moneys received from the sale of the bonds shall be deposited in a fund hereby created in
the State Treasury to be known as the Texas Water Development Fund to be administered
(without further appropriation) by the Texas Water Development Board in such manner as
prescribed by law.
(d) Such fund shall be used only for the purpose of aiding or making funds available upon such
terms and conditions as the Legislature may prescribe, to the various political subdivisions or
bodies politic and corporate of the State of Texas including river authorities, conservation and
reclamation districts and districts created or organized or authorized to be created or organized
under Article XVI, Section 59 or Article III, Section 52, of this Constitution, interstate compact
commissions to which the State of Texas is a party and municipal corporations, in the
conservation and development of the water resources of this State, including the control, storing
and preservation of its storm and flood waters and the waters of its rivers and streams, for all
useful and lawful purposes by the acquisition, improvement, extension, or construction of dams,
reservoirs and other water storage projects, including any system necessary for the transportation
of water from storage to points of treatment and/or distribution, including facilities for
transporting water therefrom to wholesale purchasers, or for any one or more of such purposes or
methods.
(e) Any or all financial assistance as provided herein shall be repaid with interest upon such
terms, conditions and manner of repayment as may be provided by law.
(f) While any of the Texas Water Development Bonds, or any interest on any of such bonds, is
outstanding and unpaid, there is hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the
Treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount which is
sufficient to pay the principal and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such
fiscal year, less the amount in the sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year.
(g) The Legislature may provide for the investment of moneys available in the Texas Water
Development Fund, and the interest and sinking funds established for the payment of bonds
issued by the Texas Water Development Board.  Income from such investment shall be used for
the purposes prescribed by the Legislature.  The Legislature may also make appropriations from
the General Revenue Fund for paying administrative expenses of the Board.
(h) From the moneys received by the Texas Water Development Board as repayment of principal
for financial assistance or as interest thereon, there shall be deposited in the interest and sinking
fund for the bonds sufficient moneys to pay the interest and principal to become due during the
ensuing year and sufficient to establish and maintain a reserve in said fund equal to the average
annual principal and interest requirements on all outstanding bonds.  If any year moneys are
received in excess of the foregoing requirements then such excess shall be deposited to the Texas
Water Development Fund, and may be used for administrative expenses of the Board and for the
same purposes and upon the same terms and conditions prescribed for the proceeds derived from
the sale of such State bonds.
(i) All Texas Water Development Bonds shall after approval by the Attorney General,
registration by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the
purchasers, be incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of Texas under
the Constitution of Texas.  (Added Nov. 5, 1957; amended Nov. 2, 1999.)

Sec. 49 d.  ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF WATER STORAGE FACILITIES;
FILTRATION, TREATMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION OF WATER; ENLARGEMENT
OF RESERVOIRS.  (a) It is hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Texas to encourage
the optimum development of the limited number of feasible sites available for the construction or
enlargement of dams and reservoirs for conservation of the public waters of the state, which
waters are held in trust for the use and benefit of the public, and to encourage the optimum
regional development of systems built for the filtration, treatment, and transmission of water and
wastewater.  The proceeds from the sale of bonds deposited in the Texas Water Development
Fund may be used by the Texas Water Development Board, under such provisions as the
Legislature may prescribe by General Law, including the requirement of a permit for storage or
beneficial use, for the additional purposes of acquiring and developing storage facilities, and any
system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment and transportation of water or waste water,
or for any one or more of such purposes or methods, whether or not such a system or works is
connected with a reservoir in which the state has a financial interest; provided, however, the
Texas Water Development Fund or any other state fund provided for water development,
transmission, transfer or filtration shall not be used to finance any project which contemplates or
results in the removal from the basin of origin of any surface water necessary to supply the
reasonably foreseeable future water requirements for the next ensuing fifty year period within the
river basin of origin, except on a temporary, interim basis.
     (b) Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law the Texas
Water Development Fund may be used for the conservation and development of water for useful
purposes by construction or reconstruction or enlargement of reservoirs constructed or to be
constructed or enlarged within the State of Texas or on any stream constituting a boundary of the
State of Texas, together with any system or works necessary for the filtration, treatment and/or
transportation of water, by any one or more of the following governmental agencies:  by the
United States of America or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by the State of
Texas or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof; by political subdivisions or bodies
politic and corporate of the state; by interstate compact commissions to which the State of Texas
is a party; and by municipal corporations.  The Legislature shall provide terms and conditions
under which the Texas Water Development Board may sell, transfer or lease, in whole or in part,
any reservoir and associated system or works which the Texas Water Development Board has
financed in whole or in part.
     (c) Under such provisions as the Legislature may prescribe by General Law, the Texas
Water Development Board may also execute long term contracts with the United States or any of
its agencies for the acquisition and development of storage facilities in reservoirs constructed or
to be constructed by the Federal Government.  Such contracts when executed shall constitute
general obligations of the State of Texas in the same manner and with the same effect as state
bonds issued under the authority of Section 49 c of this article, and the provisions of Section 49 c
of this article with respect to payment of principal and interest on state bonds issued shall
likewise apply with respect to payment of principal and interest required to be paid by such
contracts.  If storage facilities are acquired for a term of years, such contracts shall contain
provisions for renewal that will protect the state's investment.
     (d) The Legislature shall provide terms and conditions for the Texas Water Development
Board to sell, transfer or lease, in whole or in part, any acquired facilities or the right to use such
facilities at a price not less than the direct cost of the Board in acquiring same; and the
Legislature may provide terms and conditions for the Board to sell any unappropriated public
waters of the state that might be stored in such facilities.  As a prerequisite to the purchase of
such storage or water, the applicant therefor shall have secured a valid permit from the state
authorizing the acquisition of such storage facilities or the water impounded therein.  The money
received from any sale, transfer or lease of facilities shall be used to pay principal and interest on
state bonds issued or contractual obligations incurred by the Texas Water Development Board,
provided that when moneys are sufficient to pay the full amount of indebtedness then outstanding
and the full amount of interest to accrue thereon, any further sums received from the sale, transfer
or lease of such facilities shall be deposited and used as provided by law.  Money received from
the sale of water, which shall include standby service, may be used for the operation and
maintenance of acquired facilities, and for the payment of principal and interest on debt incurred.

Sec. 49 d 8.  TEXAS WATER DEVELOPMENT FUND II.  (a) The Texas Water Development
Fund II is in the state treasury as a fund separate and distinct from the Texas Water Development
Fund established under Section 49 c of this article.  Money in the Texas Water Development
Fund II shall be administered without further appropriation by the Texas Water Development
Board and shall be used for any one or more of the purposes currently or formerly authorized by
Sections 49 c, 49 d, 49 d 1, 49 d 2, 49 d 5, 49 d 6, and 49 d 7 of this article, as determined by the
Texas Water Development Board.  Separate accounts shall be established in the Texas Water
Development Fund II for administering proceedings related to the purposes described in Section
49 d of this article, the purposes described in Subsection (b) of Section 49 d 7 of this article, and
all other authorized purposes.  The Texas Water Development Board is hereby authorized, at its
determination, to issue general obligation bonds for one or more accounts of the Texas Water
Development Fund II in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of bonds previously
authorized pursuant to former Section 49 d 6 and Sections 49 d 2 and 49 d 7 of this article less
the amount of bonds issued pursuant to those sections to augment the Texas Water Development
Fund and the amount of bonds issued to augment the Texas Water Development Fund II. 
Nothing in this section, however, shall grant to the Texas Water Development Board the
authority to issue bonds in excess of the total amount of those previously authorized bonds or to
issue bonds for purposes described in Subsection (b) of Section 49 d 7 of this article in excess of
$250 million.  The expenses of the Texas Water Development Board in connection with the
issuance of bonds for an account of the Texas Water Development Fund II and administration of
such account may be paid from money in such account.
     (b) The Texas Water Development Board is hereby authorized, at its determination, to
issue general obligation bonds for one or more accounts of the Texas Water Development Fund
II in order to refund outstanding bonds previously issued to augment the Texas Water
Development Fund, as long as the principal amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the
outstanding principal amount of the refunded bonds, and to refund the general obligation of the
State of Texas under long term contracts entered into by the Texas Water Development Board
with the United States or any of its agencies under authority granted by Section 49 d of this
article, as long as the principal amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the principal
amount of the contractual obligation of the Texas Water Development Board.  Money and assets
in the Texas Water Development Fund attributable to such refunding bonds shall be transferred
to the appropriate account of the Texas Water Development Fund II, as determined by the Texas
Water Development Board, to the extent not inconsistent with the proceedings authorizing any
outstanding bonds issued to augment the Texas Water Development Fund and the terms of any
long term contracts entered into by the Texas Water Development Board with the United States
or any of its agencies.  In addition, the Texas Water Development Board may transfer other
moneys and assets in the Texas Water Development Fund to the appropriate account of the Texas
Water Development Fund II, as determined by the Texas Water Development Board, without the
necessity of issuing refunding bonds to effect the transfer, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing any outstanding bonds issued to augment the Texas Water Development
Fund.  Further, at such time as all bonds issued to augment the Texas Water Development Fund
and all such contractual obligations have been paid or otherwise discharged, all money and assets
in the Texas Water Development Fund shall be transferred to the credit of the Texas Water
Development Fund II and deposited to the accounts therein, as determined by the Texas Water
Development Board.
     (c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 49 d of this article, the legislature shall
provide terms and conditions under which the Texas Water Development Board may sell,
transfer, or lease, in whole or in part, facilities held for the account established within the Texas
Water Development Fund II for administering proceedings related to the purposes described in
Section 49 d of this article, and the legislature may provide terms and conditions under which the
Texas Water Development Board may sell any unappropriated public waters of the state that may
be stored in such facilities.  Money received from any sale, transfer, or lease of such facilities or
water shall be credited to the account established within the Texas Water Development Fund II
for the purpose of administering proceedings related to the purposes described in Section 49 d of
this article.
     (d) Each account of the Texas Water Development Fund II shall consist of:
                    (1) the Texas Water Development Board's rights to receive repayment of financial
          assistance provided from such account, together with any evidence of such rights;
                    (2) money received from the sale or other disposition of the Texas Water

          Development Board for such account, including money and assets transferred
          from the Texas Water Development Fund pursuant to this section;
                    (5) money deposited in such account pursuant to Subsection (c) of this section;
                    (6) payments received by the Texas Water Development Board under a bond
          enhancement agreement as authorized by law with respect to bonds issued for
          such account; and
                    (7) interest and other income received from investment of money in such account.
     (e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the principal of and interest on the
general obligation bonds issued for an account of the Texas Water Development Fund II,
including payments by the Texas Water Development Board under a bond enhancement
agreement as authorized by law with respect to principal of or interest on such bonds, shall be
paid out of such account, but the money in such account that is not immediately committed to the
purposes of such account or the payment of expenses may be invested as authorized by law until
the money is needed for those purposes.  If there is not enough money in any account available to
pay the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds issued for such account,
including money to make payments by the Texas Water Development Board under a bond
enhancement agreement as authorized by law with respect to principal of or interest on such
bonds, there is appropriated out of the first money coming into the state treasury in each fiscal
year not otherwise appropriated by this constitution an amount that is sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds that mature or become due during that
fiscal year or to make bond enhancement payments with respect to those bonds.
     (f) The general obligation bonds authorized by this section may be issued as bonds, notes,
or other obligations as permitted by law and shall be sold in forms and denominations, on terms,
at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments, all as determined by the Texas Water
Development Board.  The bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Texas Water
Development Board determines.  The bonds authorized by this section shall be incontestable
after execution by the Texas Water Development Board, approval by the attorney general, and
delivery to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds.
     (g) This section being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Texas Water Development Fund II, there is hereby reposed in the
legislature full power to implement and effectuate the design and objects of this section,
including the power to delegate such duties, responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Texas
Water Development Board as it believes necessary.
     (h) The Texas Water Development Fund II, including any account in that fund, may not
be used to finance or aid any project that contemplates or results in the removal from the basin of
origin of any surface water necessary to supply the reasonably foreseeable future water
requirements for the next ensuing 50 year period within the river basin of origin, except on a
temporary, interim basis.

with the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas to be known as the Texas Park
Development Fund to be administered (without further appropriation) by the said Parks and
Wildlife Department, or its said successor, in such manner as prescribed by law.

hereby appropriated out of the first moneys coming into the Treasury in each fiscal year, not
otherwise appropriated by this Constitution, an amount which is sufficient to pay the principal
and interest on such bonds that mature or become due during such fiscal year, less the amount in
the interest and sinking fund at the close of the prior fiscal year, which includes any receipts
derived during the prior fiscal year by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor,
from admission charges to State Parks, as the Legislature may prescribe by general law.

(f) From the moneys received by said Parks and Wildlife Department, or its said successor, from
the sale of the bonds issued hereunder, there shall be deposited in the interest and sinking fund
for the bonds authorized by this section sufficient moneys to pay the interest to become due
during the State fiscal year in which the bonds were issued.  After all bonds have been fully paid
with interest, or after there are on deposit in the interest and sinking fund sufficient moneys to
pay all future maturities of principal and interest, additional moneys received from admission
charges to State Parks shall be deposited to the State Parks Fund, or any successor fund which
may be established by the Legislature as a depository for Park revenue earned by said Parks and
Wildlife Department, or its said successor.
(g) All bonds issued hereunder shall after approval by the Attorney General, registration by the
Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, and delivery to the purchasers, be
incontestable and shall constitute general obligations of the State of Texas under the Constitution
of Texas.  (Added Nov. 11, 1967; amended Nov. 7, 1995, and Nov. 2, 1999.)

     (b) Each county shall, in the manner provided for justice of the peace and constable
precincts, be divided into four commissioners precincts in each of which there shall be elected by
the qualified voters thereof one County Commissioner, who shall hold his office for four years
and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.  The County Commissioners so chosen,
with the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court,
which shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this
Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.

Justice and Constable in office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office
beginning on or after the effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct in which the
person resides for the term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in
boundaries places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or
appointed, abolishes the precinct for which he was elected or appointed, or temporarily results in
extra Justices or Constables serving in a precinct.  When, as a result of a change of precinct
boundaries, a vacancy occurs in the office of Justice of the Peace or Constable, the
Commissioners Court shall fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general election.
     (d) When the boundaries of commissioners precincts are changed, each commissioner in
office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office beginning on or after the
effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct to which each was elected or appointed
for the entire term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in boundaries
places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or appointed.
     (e) The office of Constable in Mills County is abolished.  The powers, duties, and records
of the office are transferred to the County Sheriff.
     (f) The office of Constable in Reagan County and the office of Constable in Roberts
County are abolished.  The functions of the office are transferred to the County Sheriff.

which it is created.  An institution that is entitled to participate in dedicated funding provided by
Article VII, Section 17, of this constitution may not be entitled to participate in the funding
provided by this section.
     (d) The proceeds of the bonds or notes issued under Subsection (a) or (b) of this section
may not be used for the purpose of constructing, equipping, repairing, or rehabilitating buildings

     (e) The available university fund consists of the distributions made to it from the total
return on all investment assets of the permanent university fund, including the net income
attributable to the surface of permanent university fund land.  The amount of any distributions to
the available university fund shall be determined by the board of regents of The University of
Texas System in a manner intended to provide the available university fund with a stable and
predictable stream of annual distributions and to maintain over time the purchasing power of
permanent university fund investments and annual distributions to the available university fund. 
The amount distributed to the available university fund in a fiscal year must be not less than the
amount needed to pay the principal and interest due and owing in that fiscal year on bonds and
notes issued under this section.  If the purchasing power of permanent university fund
investments for any rolling 10 year period is not preserved, the board may not increase annual
distributions to the available university fund until the purchasing power of the permanent
university fund investments is restored, except as necessary to pay the principal and interest due
and owing on bonds and notes issued under this section.  An annual distribution made by the
board to the available university fund during any fiscal year may not exceed an amount equal to
seven percent of the average net fair market value of permanent university fund investment assets

available university fund, there shall be appropriated an annual sum sufficient to pay the
principal and interest due on the bonds and notes issued by the Board of Regents of The Texas
A&M University System under this section and prior law, and the remainder of that one third of
the annual distribution to the available university fund shall be appropriated to the Board of
Regents of The Texas A&M University System which shall have the authority and duty in turn to
appropriate an equitable portion of the same for the support and maintenance of The Texas A&M
University System administration, Texas A&M University, and Prairie View A&M University. 
The Board of Regents of The Texas A&M University System, in making just and equitable
appropriations to Texas A&M University and Prairie View A&M University, shall exercise its
discretion with due regard to such criteria as the board may deem appropriate from year to year. 
Out of the other two thirds of the annual distribution from the permanent university fund to the
available university fund there shall be appropriated an annual sum sufficient to pay the principal
and interest due on the bonds and notes issued by the Board of Regents of The University of
Texas System under this section and prior law, and the remainder of such two thirds of the
annual distribution to the available university fund, shall be appropriated for the support and
maintenance of The University of Texas at Austin and The University of Texas System
administration.

available university fund, mature serially or otherwise in not more than 30 years from their
respective dates, and, except for refunding bonds, be sold only through competitive bidding.  All
of these bonds and notes are subject to approval by the attorney general and when so approved
are incontestable.  The permanent university fund may be invested in these bonds and notes.
     (h) To assure efficient use of construction funds and the orderly development of physical
plants to accommodate the state's real need, the legislature may provide for the approval or
disapproval of all new construction projects at the eligible agencies and institutions entitled to
participate in the funding provided by this section except The University of Texas at Austin,
Texas A&M University in College Station, and Prairie View A&M University.
     (i) The state systems and institutions of higher education designated in this section may
not receive any funds from the general revenue of the state for acquiring land with or without
permanent improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other permanent
improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other permanent
improvements except that:
                    (1) in the case of fire or natural disaster the legislature may appropriate from the
          general revenue an amount sufficient to replace the uninsured loss of any building
          or other permanent improvement; and
                    (2) the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may, in cases of
          demonstrated need, which need must be clearly expressed in the body of the act,
          appropriate general revenue funds for acquiring land with or without permanent
          improvements, for constructing or equipping buildings or other permanent
          improvements, or for major repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other
          permanent improvements.
This subsection does not apply to legislative appropriations made prior to the adoption of this
amendment.
     (j) This section is self enacting on the issuance of the governor's proclamation declaring
the adoption of this amendment, and the state comptroller of public accounts shall do all things
necessary to effectuate this section.  This section does not impair any obligation created by the
issuance of bonds or notes in accordance with prior law, and all outstanding bonds and notes
shall be paid in full, both principal and interest, in accordance with their terms, and the changes
herein made in the allocation of the available university fund shall not affect the pledges thereof
made in connection with such bonds or notes heretofore issued.  If the provisions of this section
conflict with any other provision of this constitution, then the provisions of this section shall
prevail, notwithstanding any such conflicting provisions.

($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of persons, married or unmarried,
including those living alone, who are under a disability for purposes of payment of disability
insurance benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance or its successor or
of married or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of age or older, including those living
alone, from all ad valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  As an alternative,
upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the voters who voted in the last
preceding election held by the political subdivision, the governing body of the subdivision shall
call an election to determine by majority vote whether an amount not less than Three Thousand
Dollars ($3,000) as provided in the petition, of the market value of residence homesteads of
disabled persons or of persons sixty five (65) years of age or over shall be exempt from ad
valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  An eligible disabled person who is
sixty five (65) years of age or older may not receive both exemptions from the same political
subdivision in the same year but may choose either if the subdivision has adopted both.  Where
any ad valorem tax has theretofore been pledged for the payment of any debt, the taxing officers
of the political subdivision shall have authority to continue to levy and collect the tax against the
homestead property at the same rate as the tax so pledged until the debt is discharged, if the
cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature by general law may
provide that all or part of the exemption does not apply to a district or political subdivision that
imposes ad valorem taxes for public education purposes but is not the principal school district
providing general elementary and secondary public education throughout its territory.  In addition
to this exemption, the legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is
disabled as defined in Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty five (65) years of age or
older from ad valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes. 
The legislature by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional
exemption authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years
of age or older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age
or older may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An
eligible person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all
residence homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but
the legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1 d 1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that
homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased
while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who receives the
exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the person
received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it remains
the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55) years of
age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law. 
The legislature, by general law, may provide for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a
limitation provided by this subsection for a person who qualifies for the limitation and
establishes a different residence homestead.  However, taxes otherwise limited by this subsection
may be increased to the extent the value of the homestead is increased by improvements other
than repairs or improvements made to comply with governmental requirements and except as
may be consistent with the transfer of a limitation under this subsection.  For a residence
homestead subject to the limitation provided by this subsection in the 1996 tax year or an earlier
tax year, the legislature shall provide for a reduction in the amount of the limitation for the 1997
tax year and subsequent tax years in an amount equal to $10,000 multiplied by the 1997 tax rate
for general elementary and secondary public school purposes applicable to the residence
homestead.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may exempt from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence
homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  In the manner provided
by law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that purpose may exempt
from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a
married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed twenty
percent.  However, the amount of an exemption authorized pursuant to this subsection may not
be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the legislature by general law prescribes
other monetary restrictions on the amount of the exemption.  An eligible adult is entitled to
receive other applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad valorem tax has previously been
pledged for the payment of debt, the governing body of a political subdivision may continue to
levy and collect the tax against the value of the homesteads exempted under this subsection until
the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by
which the debt was created.  The legislature by general law may prescribe procedures for the
administration of residence homestead exemptions.
     (e 1) (Added Nov. 3, 1981; expired Jan. 2, 1982.)
     (f) The surviving spouse of a person who received an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section for the residence homestead of a person sixty five (65) years of age or older is
entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same political subdivision in an amount
equal to that of the exemption received by the deceased spouse if the deceased spouse died in a
year in which the deceased spouse received the exemption, the surviving spouse was fifty five
(55) years of age or older when the deceased spouse died, and the property was the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence
homestead of the surviving spouse.  A person who receives an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section is not entitled to an exemption under this subsection.  The legislature by general law
may prescribe procedures for the administration of this subsection.
     (g) If the legislature provides for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a tax
limitation provided by Subsection (d) of this section for a person who qualifies for the limitation
and subsequently establishes a different residence homestead, the legislature by general law may
authorize the governing body of a school district to elect to apply the law providing for the
transfer of the tax limitation to a change of a person's residence homestead that occurred before
that law took effect, subject to any restrictions provided by general law.  The transfer of the
limitation may apply only to taxes imposed in a tax year that begins after the tax year in which
the election is made.

Sec. 1 j.  CERTAIN TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM AD VALOREM
TAXATION.  (a) To promote economic development in the State, goods, wares, merchandise,
other tangible personal property, and ores, other than oil, natural gas, and other petroleum
products, are exempt from ad valorem taxation if:
                    (1) the property is acquired in or imported into this State to be forwarded outside
          this State, whether or not the intention to forward the property outside this State is
          formed or the destination to which the property is forwarded is specified when the
          property is acquired in or imported into this State;
                    (2) the property is detained in this State for assembling, storing, manufacturing,

          date the person acquired or imported the property in this State.
     (b) The governing body of a county, common, or independent school district, junior
college district, or municipality that, acting under previous constitutional authority, taxes
property otherwise exempt by Subsection (a) of this section may subsequently exempt the
property from taxation by rescinding its action to tax the property.  The exemption applies to
each tax year that begins after the date the action is taken and applies to the tax year in which the
action is taken if the governing body so provides.  A governing body that rescinds its action to
tax the property may not take action to tax such property after the rescission.
     (c) For purposes of this section:
                    (1) tangible personal property shall include aircraft and aircraft parts;
                    (2) property imported into this State shall include property brought into this State;

Sec. 2.  OCCUPATION TAXES; EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY; EXEMPTIONS FROM
TAXATION.  (a) All occupation taxes shall be equal and uniform upon the same class of
subjects within the limits of the authority levying the tax; but the legislature may, by general
laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes; actual places of religious
worship, also any property owned by a church or by a strictly religious society for the exclusive
use as a dwelling place for the ministry of such church or religious society, and which yields no
revenue whatever to such church or religious society; provided that such exemption shall not
extend to more property than is reasonably necessary for a dwelling place and in no event more
than one acre of land; places of burial not held for private or corporate profit; solar or wind
powered energy devices; all buildings used exclusively and owned by persons or associations of
persons for school purposes and the necessary furniture of all schools and property used
exclusively and reasonably necessary in conducting any association engaged in promoting the
religious, educational and physical development of boys, girls, young men or young women
operating under a State or National organization of like character; also the endowment funds of
such institutions of learning and religion not used with a view to profit; and when the same are
invested in bonds or mortgages, or in land or other property which has been and shall hereafter be
bought in by such institutions under foreclosure sales made to satisfy or protect such bonds or
mortgages, that such exemption of such land and property shall continue only for two years after
the purchase of the same at such sale by such institutions and no longer, and institutions engaged
primarily in public charitable functions, which may conduct auxiliary activities to support those
charitable functions; and all laws exempting property from taxation other than the property
mentioned in this Section shall be null and void.
     (b) The Legislature may, by general law, exempt property owned by a disabled veteran or
by the surviving spouse and surviving minor children of a disabled veteran.  A disabled veteran is
a veteran of the armed services of the United States who is classified as disabled by the Veterans'
Administration or by a successor to that agency; or the military service in which he served.  A
veteran who is certified as having a disability of less than 10 percent is not entitled to an
exemption.  A veteran having a disability rating of not less than 10 percent nor more than 30
percent may be granted an exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $5,000.  A
veteran having a disability rating of more than 30 percent but not more than 50 percent may be
granted an exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $7,500.  A veteran having a
disability rating of more than 50 percent but not more than 70 percent may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $10,000.  A veteran who has a disability
rating of more than 70 percent, or a veteran who has a disability rating of not less than 10 percent
and has attained the age of 65, or a disabled veteran whose disability consists of the loss or loss
of use of one or more limbs, total blindness in one or both eyes, or paraplegia, may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $12,000.  The spouse and children of any
member of the United States Armed Forces who dies while on active duty may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $5,000.  A deceased disabled veteran's
surviving spouse and children may be granted an exemption which in the aggregate is equal to
the exemption to which the veteran was entitled when the veteran died.
     (c) The Legislature by general law may exempt from ad valorem taxation property that is
owned by a nonprofit organization composed primarily of members or former members of the
armed forces of the United States or its allies and chartered or incorporated by the United States
Congress.
     (d) Unless otherwise provided by general law enacted after January 1, 1995, the amounts
of the exemptions from ad valorem taxation to which a person is entitled under Section 11.22,
Tax Code, for a tax year that begins on or after the date this subsection takes effect are the
maximum amounts permitted under Subsection (b) of this section instead of the amounts
specified by Section 11.22, Tax Code.  This subsection may be repealed by the Legislature by
general law.

Sec. 5.  CITY OF AMARILLO; WICHITA COUNTY; JEFFERSON COUNTY; CREATION
AND FUNDING OF HOSPITAL DISTRICTS.  (a) The Legislature may by law authorize the
creation of two hospital districts, one to be coextensive with and have the same boundaries as the
incorporated City of Amarillo, as such boundaries now exist or as they may hereafter be lawfully
extended, and the other to be coextensive with Wichita County.
     If such district or districts are created, they may be authorized to levy a tax not to exceed
Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation of taxable property
within the district; provided, however, no tax may be levied until approved by a majority vote of
the participating resident qualified voters.  The maximum rate of tax may be changed at
subsequent elections so long as obligations are not impaired, and not to exceed the maximum
limit of Seventy five Cents (75) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation, and no election
shall be required by subsequent changes in the boundaries of the City of Amarillo.
     If such tax is authorized, no political subdivision or municipality within or having the
same boundaries as the district may levy a tax for medical or hospital care for needy individuals,
nor shall they maintain or erect hospital facilities, but the district shall by resolution assume all
such responsibilities and shall assume all of the liabilities and obligations (including bonds and
warrants) of such subdivisions or municipalities or both.  The maximum tax rate submitted shall
be sufficient to discharge such obligations, liabilities, and responsibilities, and to maintain and
operate the hospital system, and the Legislature may authorize the district to issue tax bonds for
the purpose of the purchase, construction, acquisition, repair or renovation of improvements and
initially equipping the same, and such bonds shall be payable from said Seventy five Cents (75)
tax.  The Legislature shall provide for transfer of title to properties to the district.
     (b) The Legislature may by law permit the County of Potter (in which the City of
Amarillo is partially located) to render financial aid to that district by paying a part of the
expenses of operating and maintaining the system and paying a part of the debts of the district
(whether assumed or created by the district) and may authorize the levy of a tax not to exceed
Ten Cents (10) per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) valuation (in addition to other taxes
permitted by this Constitution) upon all property within the county but without the City of
Amarillo at the time such levy is made for such purposes.  If such tax is authorized, the district
shall by resolution assume the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities of the county in the
manner and to the extent hereinabove provided for political subdivisions having boundaries
coextensive with the district, and the county shall not thereafter levy taxes (other than herein
provided) for hospital purposes nor for providing hospital care for needy individuals of the
county.
     (c) The Legislature may by law authorize the creation of a hospital district within
Jefferson County, the boundaries of which shall include only the area comprising the Jefferson
County Drainage District No. 7 and the Port Arthur Independent School District, as such
boundaries existed on the first day of January, 1957, with the power to issue bonds for the sole
purpose of purchasing a site for, and the construction and initial equipping of, a hospital system,
and with the power to levy a tax of not to exceed Seventy five Cents (75) on the One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) valuation of property therein for the purpose of paying the principal and
interest on such bonds.
     The bonds may not be issued or such tax be levied until approved by such voters.
     The district shall not have the power to levy any tax for maintenance or operation of the
hospital or facilities, but shall contract with other political subdivisions of the state or private
individuals, associations, or corporations for such purposes.
     If the district hereinabove authorized is finally created, no other hospital district may be
created embracing any part of the territory within its boundaries, but the Legislature by law may

Sec. 12.  AIRPORT AUTHORITIES.  (a) The Legislature may by law provide for the creation,
establishment, maintenance and operation of Airport Authorities composed of one or more
counties, with power to issue general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, either or both of them, for
the purchase, acquisition by the exercise of the power of eminent domain or otherwise,
construction, reconstruction, repair or renovation of any airport or airports, landing fields and
runways, airport buildings, hangars, facilities, equipment, fixtures, and any and all property, real
or personal, necessary to operate, equip and maintain an airport.
     (b) The Legislature shall provide for the option by the governing body of the city or cities
whose airport facilities are served by certificated airlines and whose facility or some interest
therein, is proposed to be or has been acquired by the Authority, to either appoint or elect a Board
of Directors of said Authority.  If the Directors are appointed such appointment shall be made by
the County Commissioners Court after consultation with and consent of the governing body or
bodies of such city or cities.  If the Board of Directors is elected they shall be elected by the
qualified voters of the county which chooses to elect the Directors to represent that county. 
Directors shall serve without compensation for a term fixed by the Legislature not to exceed six
(6) years, shall be selected on the basis of the proportionate population of each county based
upon the last preceding Federal Census, and shall be residents of such county.  No county shall
have less than one (1) member on the Board of Directors.
     (c) The Legislature shall provide for the holding of an election in each county proposing
the creation of an Authority to be called by the Commissioners Court or Commissioners Courts,
as the case may be, upon petition of five per cent (5%) of the qualified voters within the county
or counties.  The elections must be held on the same day if more than one county is included.  No
more than one (1) such election may be called in a county until after the expiration of one (1)
year in the event such an election has failed, and thereafter only upon a petition of ten per cent
(10%) of the qualified  voters being presented to the Commissioners Court or Commissioners
Courts of the county or counties in which such an election has failed.  In the event that two or
more counties vote on the proposition of the creation of an Authority therein, the proposition
shall not be deemed to carry unless the majority of the qualified voters in each county voting
thereon vote in favor thereof.  An Airport Authority may be created and be composed of the
county or counties that vote in favor of its creation if separate propositions are submitted to the
voters of each county so that they may vote for a two or more county Authority or a single county
Authority.
     (d) The Legislature shall provide for the appointment by the Board of Directors of an
Assessor and Collector of Taxes in the Authority, whether constituted of one or more counties,
whose duty it shall be to assess all taxable property, both real and personal, and collect the taxes
thereon, based upon the tax rolls approved by the Board of Directors, the tax to be levied not to
exceed Seventy Five Cents ($.75) per One Hundred Dollars ($100) assessed valuation of the
property.  The property of state regulated common carriers required by law to pay a tax upon
intangible assets shall not be subject to taxation by the Authority.  The taxable property shall be
assessed on a valuation not to exceed the market value and shall be equal and uniform throughout
the Authority as is otherwise provided by the Constitution.
     (e) The Legislature shall authorize the purchase or acquisition by the Authority of any
existing airport facility publicly owned and financed and served by certificated airlines, in fee or
of any interest therein, or to enter into any lease agreement therefor, upon such terms and
conditions as may be mutually agreeable to the Authority and the owner of such facilities, or
authorize the acquisition of same through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.  In the
event of such acquisition, if there are any general obligation bonds that the owner of the publicly
owned airport facility has outstanding, the same shall be fully assumed by the Authority and
sufficient taxes levied by the Authority to discharge said outstanding indebtedness.  If any city or
owner has outstanding revenue bonds where the revenues of the airport have been pledged or
said bonds constitute a lien against the airport facilities, the Authority shall assume and discharge
all the obligations of the city under the ordinances and bond indentures under which said revenue
bonds have been issued and sold.
     (f) Any city which owns airport facilities not serving certificated airlines which are not
purchased or acquired or taken over as herein provided by such Authority shall have the power to
operate the same under the existing laws or as the same may hereafter be amended.
     (g) Any such Authority when created may be granted the power and authority to
promulgate, adopt and enforce appropriate zoning regulations to protect the airport from hazards
and obstructions which would interfere with the use of the airport and its facilities for landing
and take off.
     (h) An additional county or counties may be added to an existing Authority if a petition of
five per cent (5%) of the qualified voters is filed with and an election is called by the
Commissioners Court of the county or counties seeking admission to an Authority.  If the vote is
favorable, then admission may be granted to such county or counties by the Board of Directors of
the then existing Authority upon such terms and conditions as they may agree upon and
evidenced by a resolution approved by two thirds (2/3rds) of the then existing Board of Directors. 
The county or counties that may be so added to the then existing Authority shall be given
representation on the Board of Directors by adding additional directors in proportion to their
population according to the last preceding Federal Census.

have been created by the owner alone, or together with his or her spouse, in case the owner is
married.  All pretended sales of the homestead involving any condition of defeasance shall be
void.
     (d) A purchaser or lender for value without actual knowledge may conclusively rely on an

                    (2) the advance of all the additional funds is for reasonable costs necessary to
          refinance such debt or for a purpose described by Subsection (a)(2), (a)(3), or
          (a)(5) of this section.
     (f) A refinance of debt secured by the homestead, any portion of which is an extension of

     If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than
English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into
the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
     (h) A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment
as to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection
(a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
                    (1) the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation
          prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an
          extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
                    (2) the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the
          payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair
          market value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
     (i) This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages
from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value
without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit
described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit
with homestead property if:
                    (1) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure
          that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by
          Section 50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
                    (2) the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the
          foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
                    (3) the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
     (j) Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e) (i) of this section are not severable, and none of
those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held
to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This
subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and
before the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e) (i) is held to be
preempted.
     (k) "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
                    (1) that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written
          agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
                    (2) that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 62 years or older;
                    (3) that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the
          spouse of each owner;
                    (4) under which advances are provided to a borrower based on the equity in a
          borrower's homestead;
                    (5) that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances
          because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
                    (6) that requires no payment of principal or interest until:
                              (A) all borrowers have died;
                              (B) the homestead property securing the loan is sold or otherwise
               transferred;
                              (C) all borrowers cease occupying the homestead property for a period of
               longer than 12 consecutive months without prior written approval from the
               lender; or
                              (D) the borrower:
                                        (i) defaults on an obligation specified in the loan documents to
                    repair and maintain, pay taxes and assessments on, or insure the
                    homestead property;
                                        (ii) commits actual fraud in connection with the loan; or
                                        (iii) fails to maintain the priority of the lender's lien on the
                    homestead property, after the lender gives notice to the borrower,
                    by promptly discharging any lien that has priority or may obtain
                    priority over the lender's lien within 10 days after the date the
                    borrower receives the notice, unless the borrower:
                                                  (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation
                         secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to the lender;
                                                  (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against
                         enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings so as to
                         prevent the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part
                         of the homestead property; or
                                                  (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement
                         satisfactory to the lender subordinating the lien to all
                         amounts secured by the lender's lien on the homestead
                         property;
                    (7) that provides that if the lender fails to make loan advances as required in the
          loan documents and if the lender fails to cure the default as required in the loan
          documents after notice from the borrower, the lender forfeits all principal and
          interest of the reverse mortgage, provided, however, that this subdivision does not
          apply when a governmental agency or instrumentality takes an assignment of the
          loan in order to cure the default;
                    (8) that is not made unless the owner of the homestead attests in writing that the
          owner received counseling regarding the advisability and availability of reverse
          mortgages and other financial alternatives;
                    (9) that requires the lender, at the time the loan is made, to disclose to the
          borrower by written notice the specific provisions contained in Subdivision (6) of
          this subsection under which the borrower is required to repay the loan;
                    (10) that does not permit the lender to commence foreclosure until the lender
          gives notice to the borrower, in the manner provided for a notice by mail related
          to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section, that a ground for
          foreclosure exists and gives the borrower at least 30 days, or at least 20 days in the
          event of a default under Subdivision (6)(D)(iii) of this subsection, to:
                              (A) remedy the condition creating the ground for foreclosure;
                              (B) pay the debt secured by the homestead property from proceeds of the
               sale of the homestead property by the borrower or from any other sources;
               or
                              (C) convey the homestead property to the lender by a deed in lieu of
               foreclosure; and
                    (11) that is secured by a lien that may be foreclosed upon only by a court order, if

over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead
property is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of
that county.
     (m) A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and
may also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the
homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a
reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be
compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
     (n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be
made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:

          proceeds;

          open end account advances;
                    (3) a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over
          intervening advances;
                    (4) a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage
          loan documents;
                    (5) a prohibition on balloon payments;
                    (6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
                    (7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest
          authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of
          interest; and
                    (8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced
          before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.

          from a loan and not income; and
                    (2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a
          borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
     (p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is
made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of
the following methods:
                    (1) at regular intervals;
                    (2) at regular intervals in which the amounts advanced may be reduced, for one or
          more advances, at the request of the borrower; or
                    (3) at any time by the lender, on behalf of the borrower, if the borrower fails to
          timely pay any of the following that the borrower is obligated to pay under the
          loan documents to the extent necessary to protect the lender's interest in or the
          value of the homestead property:
                              (A) taxes;
                              (B) insurance;
                              (C) costs of repairs or maintenance performed by a person or company that
               is not an employee of the lender or a person or company that directly or
               indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the
               lender;
                              (D) assessments levied against the homestead property; and
                              (E) any lien that has, or may obtain, priority over the lender's lien as it is
               established in the loan documents.
     (q) To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section
41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on
homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit
described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent
that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner
provided for by this amendment.
     (r) The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure
proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section and to
foreclosure of a reverse mortgage lien that requires a court order.
     (s) The Finance Commission of Texas shall appoint a director to conduct research on the

          research and organizational activities leading to business formation and

The governing boards of the permanent university fund, the permanent school fund, the Teacher
Retirement System of Texas, the Employees Retirement System of Texas, and any other pension
system created under this constitution or by statute of this state in their sole discretion may make
investments in the fund.
     (c) The fund is managed by a board of trustees consisting of four public members
appointed by the governor and one member from and elected by the membership of each of the
following:
                    (1) the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System;

                    (5) the State Board of Education.

          management of investments under this section with a private investment
          management firm or with an investing fund or system electing a member of the
          board of trustees.
     (g) In making investments, including venture capital investments, the board of trustees
shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of
ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering
the probable income as well as the probable safety of the capital of the fund.  All investments of
the fund shall be directly related to the creation, retention, or expansion of employment
opportunity and economic growth in Texas.  In making venture capital investments, all other

investing fund or system, as determined at the end of each fiscal year.
     (j) The board of trustees shall establish criteria for the investment of not more than 10
percent of the fund in venture capital investments.  Not more than 25 percent of the funds

the remainder of the funds available for venture capital investments must be matched at least
equally by funds from sources other than the fund, with matching amounts established by the
board of trustees.  The board of trustees shall also establish criteria for the investment of not less
than 50 percent of the fund in equity or debt security, or a combination of equity and debt
security, for the initial construction, expansion, or modernization of business or industrial
facilities in Texas.  The board of trustees may invest in money funds whose underlying
investments are consistent and acceptable under the investment policy of the fund.
     (k) On a quarterly basis, the amount of income realized on investments under this section
shall be distributed to each of the systems and funds investing in the Texas growth fund in
proportion to the number of participating shares of each investing system and fund.  Capital
appreciation becomes a part of the corpus of the Texas growth fund and shall be distributed in
accordance with the investment contracts.
     (l) The board of trustees shall make arrangements to begin liquidation, phase out
investments, and return the principal and capital gains on investments to the investors in the fund
not later than the 10th anniversary of the date of the adoption of this section.  Except under
unusual circumstances where it may be necessary to protect investments previously made, further
investments may not be made in or by the fund after the 10th anniversary of the date of the
adoption of this section.

the adoption of this section, the legislature, by two thirds vote of each house, may authorize the
creation of Texas growth fund II, which shall operate under this section and under the board of
trustees created by this section in the same manner as the Texas growth fund.  Funds in Texas
growth fund II may not be commingled with funds in the Texas growth fund.
     (n) The board of trustees may purchase liability insurance for the coverage of the trustees,
employees, and agents of the board.
     (o) The legislature shall provide by law for the periodic review of the board of trustees in
the same manner and at the same intervals as it provides for review of other state agencies,
except that the legislature shall provide that the board of trustees is not subject to abolishment as
part of the review process.
     (p) This section expires September 1, 1998, except that if the legislature authorizes the
creation of Texas growth fund II as provided by Subsection (m) of this section, this section
expires September 1, 2008.
     (q) This section is self executing and takes effect on its adoption by the voters.  All state
officials named in this section and the comptroller of public accounts shall take all necessary
actions for the implementation of this section.  The legislature shall provide by law for full
disclosure of all details concerning investments authorized by this section.

of up to $20 million of general obligation bonds to provide initial funding of the Texas small
business incubator fund.  The Texas small business incubator fund is composed of the proceeds
of the bonds authorized by this subsection, loan repayments, and other amounts received by the
state for loans or grants made under this subsection and any other amounts required to be
deposited in the Texas small business incubator fund by the legislature.
     (c) The legislature may require review and approval of the issuance of bonds under this
section, of the use of the bond proceeds, or of the rules adopted by an agency to govern use of the
bond proceeds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, any entity created or
directed to conduct this review and approval may include members, or appointees of members, of
the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of state government.
     (d) Bonds authorized under this section constitute a general obligation of the state.  While
any of the bonds or interest on the bonds is outstanding and unpaid, there is appropriated out of
the first money coming into the treasury in each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this
constitution, the amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds that mature or
become due during the fiscal year, less any amount in any interest and sinking account at the end
of the preceding fiscal year that is pledged to payment of the bonds or interest.

committed to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds, the making of home mortgage
loans, or the payment of expenses may be invested as authorized by law until the money is
needed for those purposes. 
(o) The Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund shall consist of: 
          (1) the Board's interest in home mortgage loans the Board makes to veterans from money

the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II that the Board determines are not required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds benefitting those funds,
including payments by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal
of or interest on the bonds, may be used by the Board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing the bonds to: 
          (1) make temporary transfers to another of those funds to avoid a temporary cash
     deficiency in that fund or make a transfer to another of those funds for the purposes of
     that fund;

secured only by receipts of the funds, assets transferred from the funds, and other revenues and
assets as determined by the Board and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the
Veterans' Land Board. The Board may issue revenue bonds from time to time, which bonds may
not exceed an aggregate principal amount that the Board determines can be fully retired from the
receipts of the funds, the assets transferred from the funds, and the other revenues and assets
pledged to the retirement of the revenue bonds. Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified by
any other provision of this constitution, revenue bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the
Board determines. A determination made by the Board under this subsection shall be binding and
conclusive as to the matter determined. 
(u) The bonds authorized to be issued and sold by the Veterans' Land Board shall be issued and
sold in forms and denominations, on terms, at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments

responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.

reconstruction, acquisition, and expansion of state highways, including costs of any necessary
design and costs of acquisition of rights-of-way, as determined by the commission in accordance
with standards and procedures established by law.
(c) Money in the fund may also be used to provide participation by the state in the payment of a
portion of the costs of constructing and providing publicly owned toll roads and other public
transportation projects in accordance with the procedures, standards, and limitations established
by law.
(d) The commission may issue and sell obligations of the state and enter into related credit
agreements that are payable from and secured by a pledge of and a lien on all or part of the
money on deposit in the fund in an aggregate principal amount that can be repaid when due from
money on deposit in the fund, as that aggregate amount is projected by the comptroller in

the maximum period established by law.
(e) The legislature by law may dedicate to the fund one or more specific sources or portions, or a
specific amount, of the revenue, including taxes, and other money of the state that are not
otherwise dedicated by this constitution.  The legislature may not dedicate money from the
collection of motor vehicle registration fees and taxes on motor fuels and lubricants dedicated by
Section 7-a, Article VIII, of this constitution, but it may dedicate money received from other
sources that are allocated to the same costs as those dedicated taxes and fees.
(f) Money dedicated as provided by this section is appropriated when received by the state, shall
be deposited in the fund, and may be used as provided by this section and law enacted under this
section without further appropriation.  While money in the fund is pledged to the payment of any
outstanding obligations or related credit agreements, the dedication of a specific source or
portion of revenue, taxes, or other money made as provided by this section may not be reduced,
rescinded, or repealed unless:
(1) the legislature by law dedicates a substitute or different source that is projected by the
comptroller to be of a value equal to or greater than the source or amount being reduced,
rescinded, or repealed and authorizes the commission to implement the authority granted by
Subsection (g) of this section; and

provided by Subsection (e) of this section, the legislature may by law authorize the commission
to guarantee the payment of any obligations and credit agreements issued and executed by the
commission under the authority of this section by pledging the full faith and credit of the state to
that payment if dedicated revenue is insufficient for that purpose.  If that authority is granted and
is implemented by the commission, while any of the bonds, notes, other obligations, or credit
agreements are outstanding and unpaid, and for any fiscal year during which the dedicated
revenue, taxes, and money are insufficient to make all payments when due, there is appropriated,
and there shall be deposited in the fund, out of the first money coming into the state treasury in
each fiscal year that is not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount that is
sufficient to pay the principal of the obligations and agreements and the interest on the
obligations and agreements that become due during that fiscal year, minus any amount in the
fund that is available for that payment in accordance with applicable law.
(h) Proceedings authorizing obligations and related credit agreements to be issued and executed
under the authority of this section shall be submitted to the attorney general for approval as to
their legality.  If the attorney general finds that they will be issued in accordance with this section

of the obligations in accordance with the terms of sale and after execution and delivery of the
related credit agreements, the obligations and related credit agreements are incontestable for any
cause.

not be included in the computation required by Section 49-j, Article III, of this constitution,
except that if money has been dedicated to the fund without specification of its source or the
authority granted by Subsection (g) of this section has been implemented, the obligations and
credit agreements shall be included to the extent the comptroller projects that general funds of the
state, if any, will be required to pay amounts due on or on account of the obligations and credit
agreements.
(j) The collection and deposit of the amounts required by this section, applicable law, and
contract to be applied to the payment of obligations and credit agreements issued, executed, and
secured under the authority of this section may be enforced by mandamus against the
commission, the department, and the comptroller in a district court of Travis County, and the

Subject to the further provisions of this Section, the Legislature shall provide for the retirement
and compensation of Justices and Judges of the Appellate Courts and District and Criminal
District Courts on account of length of service, age and disability, and for their reassignment to
active duty where and when needed.  The office of every such Justice and Judge shall become
vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy five (75) years or such earlier age, not less
than seventy (70) years, as the Legislature may prescribe.
     (2) The State Commission on Judicial Conduct consists of eleven (11) members, to wit: 
(i)  one (1) Justice of a Court of Appeals; (ii)  one (1) District Judge; (iii)  two (2) members of the
State Bar, who have respectively practiced as such for over ten (10) consecutive years next

practice law nor holding any salaried public office or employment; (v)  one (1) Justice of the
Peace; (vi)  one (1) Judge of a Municipal Court; and, (vii)  one (1) Judge of a County Court at
Law; provided that no person shall be or remain a member of the Commission, who does not
maintain physical residence within this State, or who resides in, or holds a judgeship within or
for, the same Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission, or who shall have
ceased to retain the qualifications above specified for his respective class of membership, except
that the Justice of the Peace and the Judges of a Municipal Court and or a County Court at Law
shall be selected at large without regard to whether they reside or hold a judgeship in the same
Supreme Judicial District as another member of the Commission.  Commissioners of classes (i),
(ii), and (vii) above shall be chosen by the Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate,
those of class (iii) by the Board of Directors of the State Bar under regulations to be prescribed
by the Supreme Court with advice and consent of the Senate, those of class (iiii) by appointment
of the Governor with advice and consent of the Senate, and the commissioners of classes (v) and

     (3) The regular term of office of Commissioners shall be six (6) years; but the initial
members of each of classes (i), (ii) and (iii) shall respectively be chosen for terms of four (4) and
six (6) years, and the initial members of class (iiii) for respective terms of two (2), four (4) and
six (6) years.  Interim vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as vacancies due to expiration
of a full term, but only for the unexpired portion of the term in question.  Commissioners may
succeed themselves in office only if having served less than three (3) consecutive years.
     (4) Commissioners shall receive no compensation for their services as such.  The
Legislature shall provide for the payment of the necessary expense for the operation of the
Commission.
     (5) The Commission may hold its meetings, hearings and other proceedings at such times
and places as it shall determine but shall meet at Austin at least once each year.  It shall annually
select one of its members as Chairman.  A quorum shall consist of six (6) members.  Proceedings
shall be by majority vote of those present, except that recommendations for retirement, censure,
suspension, or removal of any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6)
of this Section shall be by affirmative vote of at least six (6) members.
               (6)  A. Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
          by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution, may,
          subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for willful or
          persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas,
          incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation of the Code
          of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent
          with the proper performance of his duties or casts public discredit upon the
          judiciary or administration of justice.  Any person holding such office may be
          disciplined or censured, in lieu of removal from office, as provided by this
          section.  Any person holding an office specified in this subsection may be
          suspended from office with or without pay by the Commission immediately on
          being indicted by a State or Federal grand jury for a felony offense or charged
          with a misdemeanor involving official misconduct.  On the filing of a sworn
          complaint charging a person holding such office with willful or persistent
          violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence in
          performing the duties of the office, willful violation of the Code of Judicial
          Conduct, or willful and persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the
          proper performance of his duties or casts public discredit on the judiciary or on
          the administration of justice, the Commission, after giving the person notice and
          an opportunity to appear and be heard before the Commission, may recommend to
          the Supreme Court the suspension of such person from office.  The Supreme
          Court, after considering the record of such appearance and the recommendation of
          the Commission, may suspend the person from office with or without pay,
          pending final disposition of the charge.
                    B. Any person holding an office named in Paragraph A of this subsection who is
          eligible for retirement benefits under the laws of this state providing for judicial
          retirement may be involuntarily retired, and any person holding an office named in
          that paragraph who is not eligible for retirement benefits under such laws may be
          removed from office, for disability seriously interfering with the performance of
          his duties, which is, or is likely to become, permanent in nature.
                    C. The law relating to the removal, discipline, suspension, or censure of a Justice
          or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created by the
          Legislature as provided in this Constitution applies to a master or magistrate
          appointed as provided by law to serve a trial court of this State and to a retired or
          former Judge who continues as a judicial officer subject to an assignment to sit on
          a court of this State.  Under the law relating to the removal of an active Justice or
          Judge, the Commission and the review tribunal may prohibit a retired or former
          Judge from holding judicial office in the future or from sitting on a court of this
          State by assignment.
     (7) The Commission shall keep itself informed as fully as may be of circumstances
relating to the misconduct or disability of particular persons holding an office named in
Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section, receive complaints or reports, formal or informal,
from any source in this behalf and make such preliminary investigations as it may determine.  Its
orders for the attendance or testimony of witnesses or for the production of documents at any
hearing or investigation shall be enforceable by contempt proceedings in the District Court or by
a Master.
     (8) After such investigation as it deems necessary, the Commission may in its discretion
issue a private or public admonition, warning, reprimand, or requirement that the person obtain
additional training or education, or if the Commission determines that the situation merits such
action, it may institute formal proceedings and order a formal hearing to be held before it
concerning the public censure, removal, or retirement of a person holding an office or position
specified in Subsection (6) of this Section, or it may in its discretion request the Supreme Court
to appoint an active or retired District Judge or Justice of a Court of Appeals, or retired Judge or
Justice of the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court, as a Master to hear and take
evidence in any such matter, and to report thereon to the Commission.  The Master shall have all
the power of a District Judge in the enforcement of orders pertaining to witnesses, evidence, and
procedure.  If, after formal hearing, or after considering the record and report of a Master, the
Commission finds good cause therefor, it shall issue an order of public censure or it shall
recommend to a review tribunal the removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the person in
question holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section and shall
thereupon file with the tribunal the entire  record before the Commission.
     (9) A tribunal to review the Commission's recommendation for the removal or retirement
of a person holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section is composed
of seven (7) Justices or Judges of the Courts of Appeals who are selected by lot by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.  Each Court of Appeals shall designate one of its members for
inclusion in the list from which the selection is made.  Service on the tribunal shall be considered
part of the official duties of a judge, and no additional compensation may be paid for such
service.  The review tribunal shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and
in its discretion may, for good cause shown, permit the introduction of additional evidence. 
Within 90 days after the date on which the record is filed with the review tribunal, it shall order
public censure, retirement or removal, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the
recommendation.  A Justice, Judge, Master, or Magistrate may appeal a decision of the review
tribunal to the Supreme Court under the substantial evidence rule.  Upon an order for involuntary
retirement for disability or an order for removal, the office in question shall become vacant.  The
review tribunal, in an order for involuntary retirement for disability or an order for removal, may
prohibit such person from holding judicial office in the future.  The rights of an incumbent so
retired to retirement benefits shall be the same as if his retirement had been voluntary.
     (10) All papers filed with and proceedings before the Commission or a Master shall be
confidential, unless otherwise provided by law, and the filing of papers with, and the giving of
testimony before the Commission or a Master shall be privileged, unless otherwise provided by
law.  However, the Commission may issue a public statement through its executive director or its
Chairman at any time during any of its proceedings under this Section when sources other than 
the Commission cause notoriety concerning a Judge or the Commission itself and the
Commission determines that the best interests of a Judge or of the public will be served by
issuing the statement.
     (11) The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for the procedure before the Commission,
Masters, review tribunal, and the Supreme Court.  Such rule shall provide the right of discovery
of evidence to a Justice, Judge, Master, or Magistrate after formal proceedings are instituted and
shall afford to any person holding an office or position specified in Subsection (6) of this Section,
against whom a proceeding is instituted to cause his retirement or removal, due process of law
for the procedure before the Commission, Masters, review tribunal, and the Supreme Court in the
same manner that any person whose property rights are in jeopardy in an adjudicatory proceeding
is entitled to due process of law, regardless of whether or not the interest of the person holding an
office or position  specified in Subsection (6) of this Section in remaining in active status is
considered to be a right or a privilege.  Due process shall include the right to notice, counsel,
hearing, confrontation of his accusers, and all such other incidents of due process as are
ordinarily available in proceedings whether or not misfeasance is charged, upon proof of which a
penalty may be imposed.
     (12) No person holding an office specified in Subsection (6) of this Section shall sit as a
member of the Commission in any proceeding involving his own suspension, discipline, censure,
retirement or removal.
     (13) This Section 1 a is alternative to and cumulative of, the methods of removal of
persons holding an office named in Paragraph A of Subsection (6) of this Section provided
elsewhere in this Constitution.
     (14) The Legislature may promulgate laws in furtherance of this Section that are not
inconsistent with its provisions.

                    the owner of the homestead a copy of all documents signed by the
                    owner related to the extension of credit;
                                        (vi) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain
                    a disclosure that the extension of credit is the type of credit defined

                    credit or a copy of an endorsement and assignment of the lien to a
                    lender that is refinancing the extension of credit;
                                        (viii) the owner of the homestead and any spouse of the owner may,
                    within three days after the extension of credit is made, rescind the

                                        (x) the lender or any holder of the note for the extension of credit
                    shall forfeit all principal and interest of the extension of credit if the
                    lender or holder fails to comply with the lender's or holder's
                    obligations under the extension of credit within a reasonable time
                    after the lender or holder is notified by the borrower of the lender's

manner as may be prescribed by law.
     (c) No mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid unless it
secures a debt described by this section, whether such mortgage, trust deed, or other lien, shall
have been created by the owner alone, or together with his or her spouse, in case the owner is
married.  All pretended sales of the homestead involving any condition of defeasance shall be
void.
     (d) A purchaser or lender for value without actual knowledge may conclusively rely on an

property to be conveyed or encumbered is not the homestead of the affiant.
     (e) A refinance of debt secured by a homestead and described by any subsection under
Subsections (a)(1) (a)(5) that includes the advance of additional funds may not be secured by a

                    (1) the refinance of the debt is an extension of credit described by Subsection (a)(6)
          of this section; or
                    (2) the advance of all the additional funds is for reasonable costs necessary to
          refinance such debt or for a purpose described by Subsection (a)(2), (a)(3), or
          (a)(5) of this section.
     (f) A refinance of debt secured by the homestead, any portion of which is an extension of
credit described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section, may not be secured by a valid lien against the
homestead unless the refinance of the debt is an extension of credit described by Subsection (a)(6)
of this section.
     (g) An extension of credit described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section may be secured by
a valid lien against homestead property if the extension of credit is not closed before the 12th day

     If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than
English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into
the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
     (h) A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment as
to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection
(a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
                    (1) the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation
          prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an
          extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
                    (2) the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the
          payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair market
          value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
     (i) This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages
from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value
without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit
described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit with
homestead property if:
                    (1) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure
          that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by
          Section 50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
                    (2) the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the
          foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
                    (3) the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
     (j) Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e) (i) of this section are not severable, and none of
those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held
to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This
subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and before
the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e) (i) is held to be preempted.
     (k) "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
                    (1) that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written
          agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
                    (2) that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 62 years or older;
                    (3) that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the
          spouse of each owner;
                    (4) under which advances are provided to a borrower based on the equity in a
          borrower's homestead;
                    (5) that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances
          because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
                    (6) that requires no payment of principal or interest until:
                              (A) all borrowers have died;
                              (B) the homestead property securing the loan is sold or otherwise
               transferred;
                              (C) all borrowers cease occupying the homestead property for a period of
               longer than 12 consecutive months without prior written approval from the
               lender; or
                              (D) the borrower:
                                        (i) defaults on an obligation specified in the loan documents to
                    repair and maintain, pay taxes and assessments on, or insure the
                    homestead property;
                                        (ii) commits actual fraud in connection with the loan; or
                                        (iii) fails to maintain the priority of the lender's lien on the
                    homestead property, after the lender gives notice to the borrower, by
                    promptly discharging any lien that has priority or may obtain
                    priority over the lender's lien within 10 days after the date the
                    borrower receives the notice, unless the borrower:
                                                  (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured
                         by the lien in a manner acceptable to the lender;
                                                  (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against
                         enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings so as to prevent
                         the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the
                         homestead property; or
                                                  (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement
                         satisfactory to the lender subordinating the lien to all
                         amounts secured by the lender's lien on the homestead
                         property;
                    (7) that provides that if the lender fails to make loan advances as required in the
          loan documents and if the lender fails to cure the default as required in the loan
          documents after notice from the borrower, the lender forfeits all principal and
          interest of the reverse mortgage, provided, however, that this subdivision does not
          apply when a governmental agency or instrumentality takes an assignment of the
          loan in order to cure the default;
                    (8) that is not made unless the owner of the homestead attests in writing that the
          owner received counseling regarding the advisability and availability of reverse
          mortgages and other financial alternatives;
                    (9) that requires the lender, at the time the loan is made, to disclose to the borrower
          by written notice the specific provisions contained in Subdivision (6) of this
          subsection under which the borrower is required to repay the loan;
                    (10) that does not permit the lender to commence foreclosure until the lender gives
          notice to the borrower, in the manner provided for a notice by mail related to the
          foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section, that a ground for
          foreclosure exists and gives the borrower at least 30 days, or at least 20 days in the
          event of a default under Subdivision (6)(D)(iii) of this subsection, to:
                              (A) remedy the condition creating the ground for foreclosure;
                              (B) pay the debt secured by the homestead property from proceeds of the
               sale of the homestead property by the borrower or from any other sources;
               or
                              (C) convey the homestead property to the lender by a deed in lieu of
               foreclosure; and
                    (11) that is secured by a lien that may be foreclosed upon only by a court order, if
          the foreclosure is for a ground other than a ground stated by Subdivision (6)(A) or
          (B) of this subsection.
     (l)  Advances made under a reverse mortgage and interest on those advances have priority
over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead property
is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of that county.
     (m) A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and may
also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the
homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a
reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be
compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
     (n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be
made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:
                    (1) a limitation on the purpose and use of future advances or other mortgage
          proceeds;
                    (2) a limitation on future advances to a term of years or a limitation on the term of
          open end account advances;
                    (3) a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over
          intervening advances;
                    (4) a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage
          loan documents;
                    (5) a prohibition on balloon payments;
                    (6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
                    (7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest
          authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of
          interest; and
                    (8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced
          before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.
     (o) For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments,
allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means tested basis by this state, including
supplemental security income, low income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical
assistance, and general assistance:
                    (1) reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds
          from a loan and not income; and
                    (2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a
          borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
     (p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is
made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of
the following methods:
                    (1) at regular intervals;

Sec. 67.  STATE AND LOCAL RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.  
     (a) General Provisions.  

                    (1) The legislature may enact general laws establishing systems and programs of
          retirement and related disability and death benefits for public employees and
          officers.  Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles.  The
          assets of a system are held in trust for the benefit of members and may not be
          diverted.
                    (2) A person may not receive benefits from more than one system for the same
          service, but the legislature may provide by law that a person with service covered
          by more than one system or program is entitled to a fractional benefit from each
          system or program based on service rendered under each system or program
          calculated as to amount upon the benefit formula used in that system or program. 
          Transfer of service credit between the Employees Retirement System of Texas and
          the Teacher Retirement System of Texas also may be authorized by law.
                    (3) Each statewide benefit system must have a board of trustees to administer the
          system and to invest the funds of the system in such securities as the board may
          consider prudent investments.  In making investments, a board shall exercise the
          judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of ordinary
          prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
          affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of
          their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as the probable
          safety of their capital.  The legislature by law may further restrict the investment
          discretion of a board.
                    (4) General laws establishing retirement systems and optional retirement programs
          for public employees and officers in effect at the time of the adoption of this
          section remain in effect, subject to the general powers of the legislature established
          in this subsection.
     (b) State Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall establish by law a Teacher Retirement System of Texas to
          provide benefits for persons employed in the public schools, colleges, and
          universities supported wholly or partly by the state.  Other employees may be
          included under the system by law.
                    (2) The legislature shall establish by law an Employees Retirement System of
          Texas to provide benefits for officers and employees of the state and such state
          compensated officers and employees of appellate courts and judicial districts as
          may be included under the system by law.
                    (3) The amount contributed by a person participating in the Employees Retirement
          System of Texas or the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall be established
          by the legislature but may not be less than six percent of current compensation. 
          The amount contributed by the state may not be less than six percent nor more than
          10 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to individuals participating in the
          system.  In an emergency, as determined by the governor, the legislature may
          appropriate such additional sums as are actuarially determined to be required to
          fund benefits authorized by law.
     (c) Local Retirement Systems.  
                    (1)  The legislature shall provide by law for:
                              (A) the creation by any city or county of a system of benefits for its officers
               and employees;
                              (B) a statewide system of benefits for the officers and employees of
               counties or other political subdivisions of the state in which counties or
               other political subdivisions may voluntarily participate; and
                              (C) a statewide system of benefits for officers and employees of cities in
               which cities may voluntarily participate.
                    (2) Benefits under these systems must be reasonably related to participant tenure
          and contributions.
          (d) Judicial Retirement System.
                     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the system of retirement,
          disability, and survivors' benefits heretofore established in the constitution or by
          law for justices, judges, and commissioners of the appellate courts and judges of
          the district and criminal district courts is continued in effect.  Contributions
          required and benefits payable are to be as provided by law.
                    (2) General administration of the Judicial Retirement System of Texas is by the
          Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas under such
          regulations as may be provided by law.
     (e) Anticipatory Legislation.  Legislation enacted in anticipation of this amendment is not
void because it is anticipatory.
     (f) Retirement Systems Not Belonging to a Statewide System.  The board of trustees of a
system or program that provides retirement and related disability and death benefits for public
officers and employees and that does not participate in a statewide public retirement system shall:
                    (1) administer the system or program of benefits;
                    (2) hold the assets of the system or program for the exclusive purposes of
          providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable
          expenses of administering the system or program; and
                    (3) select legal counsel and an actuary and adopt sound actuarial assumptions to be
          used by the system or program.
     (g) If the legislature provides for a fire fighters' pension commissioner, the term of office
for that position is four years.

Sec. 18.  DIVISION OF COUNTIES INTO PRECINCTS; ELECTION OF CONSTABLE AND
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE; COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS COURT.  (a) Each county in the State with a population of 50,000 or more,
according to the most recent federal census, from time to time, for the convenience of the people,
shall be divided into not less than four and not more than eight precincts.  Each county in the State
with a population of 18,000 or more but less than 50,000, according to the most recent federal
census, from time to time, for the convenience of the people, shall be divided into not less than
two and not more than eight precincts.  Each county in the State with a population of less than
18,000, according to the most recent federal census, from time to time, for the convenience of the
people, shall be designated as a single precinct or, if the Commissioners Court determines that the
county needs more than one precinct, shall be divided into not more than four precincts. 
Notwithstanding the population requirements of this subsection, Chambers County and Randall
County, from time to time, for the convenience of the people, shall be divided into not less than
two and not more than six precincts.  A division or designation under this subsection shall be
made by the Commissioners Court provided for by this Constitution.  Except as provided by this
section, in each such precinct there shall be elected one Justice of the Peace and one Constable,
each of whom shall hold his office for four years and until his successor shall be elected and
qualified; provided that in a county with a population of less than 150,000, according to the most
recent federal census, in any precinct in which there may be a city of 18,000 or more inhabitants,
there shall be elected two Justices of the Peace, and in a county with a population of 150,000 or
more, according to the most recent federal census, each precinct may contain more than one
Justice of the Peace Court.  Notwithstanding the population requirements of this subsection, any
county that is divided into four or more precincts on November 2, 1999, shall continue to be
divided into not less than four precincts.
     (b) Each county shall, in the manner provided for justice of the peace and constable
precincts, be divided into four commissioners precincts in each of which there shall be elected by
the qualified voters thereof one County Commissioner, who shall hold his office for four years
and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.  The County Commissioners so chosen, with
the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court, which
shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this
Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.
     (c) When the boundaries of justice of the peace and constable precincts are changed, each
Justice and Constable in office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office
beginning on or after the effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct in which the
person resides for the term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in
boundaries places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or
appointed, abolishes the precinct for which he was elected or appointed, or temporarily results in
extra Justices or Constables serving in a precinct.  When, as a result of a change of precinct
boundaries, a vacancy occurs in the office of Justice of the Peace or Constable, the
Commissioners Court shall fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general election.
     (d) When the boundaries of commissioners precincts are changed, each commissioner in
office on the effective date of the change, or elected to a term of office beginning on or after the
effective date of the change, shall serve in the precinct to which each was elected or appointed for
the entire term to which each was elected or appointed, even though the change in boundaries
places the person's residence outside the precinct for which he was elected or appointed.
     (e) The office of Constable is abolished in Mills County, Reagan County, and Roberts
County.  The powers, duties, and records of the office are transferred to the County Sheriff.
     (f) The Legislature by general law may prescribe the qualifications of constables.
     (g) (Redesignated as Subsec. (f) Nov. 6, 2001.)
     (h) The commissioners court of a county may declare the office of constable in a precinct
dormant if at least seven consecutive years have passed since the end of the term of the person
who was last elected or appointed to the office and during that period of time no person was
elected to fill that office, or during that period a person was elected to that office, but the person
failed to meet the qualifications of that office or failed to assume the duties of that office.  If an
office of constable is declared dormant, the office may not be filled by election or appointment
and the previous officeholder does not continue to hold the office under Subsection (a) of this
section or Section 17, Article XVI, of this constitution.  The records of an office of constable
declared dormant are transferred to the county clerk of the county.  The commissioners court may
reinstate an office of constable declared dormant by vote of the commissioners court or by calling
an election in the precinct to reinstate the office.  The commissioners court shall call an election to
reinstate the office if the commissioners court receives a petition signed by at least 10 percent of
the qualified voters of the precinct.  If an election is called under this subsection, the
commissioners court shall order the ballot for the election to be printed to permit voting for or
against the proposition:  "Reinstating the office of Constable of Precinct No. that was previously
declared dormant."  The office of constable is reinstated if a majority of the voters of the precinct
voting on the question at the election approve the reinstatement.

     If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than
English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into
the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
     (h) A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment as
to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection
(a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
                    (1) the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation
          prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an
          extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
                    (2) the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the
          payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair market
          value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
     (i) This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages
from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value
without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit
described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit with
homestead property if:
                    (1) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure
          that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by
          Section 50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
                    (2) the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the
          foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
                    (3) the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
     (j) Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e) (i) of this section are not severable, and none of
those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held
to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This
subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and before
the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e) (i) is held to be preempted.
     (k) "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
                    (1) that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written
          agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
                    (2) that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 62 years or older;
                    (3) that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the
          spouse of each owner;
                    (4) under which advances are provided to a borrower based on the equity in a
          borrower's homestead;
                    (5) that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances
          because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
                    (6) that requires no payment of principal or interest until:

          loan in order to cure the default;
                    (8) that is not made unless the owner of the homestead attests in writing that the

                    (10) that does not permit the lender to commence foreclosure until the lender gives
          notice to the borrower, in the manner provided for a notice by mail related to the
          foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section, that a ground for
          foreclosure exists and gives the borrower at least 30 days, or at least 20 days in the
          event of a default under Subdivision (6)(D)(iii) of this subsection, to:
                              (A) remedy the condition creating the ground for foreclosure;

               foreclosure; and
                    (11) that is secured by a lien that may be foreclosed upon only by a court order, if
          the foreclosure is for a ground other than a ground stated by Subdivision (6)(A) or

     (l)  Advances made under a reverse mortgage and interest on those advances have priority
over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead property
is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of that county.
     (m) A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and may
also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the
homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a
reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be
compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
     (n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be
made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:

          loan documents;
                    (5) a prohibition on balloon payments;
                    (6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
                    (7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest
          authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of
          interest; and
                    (8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced
          before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.
     (o) For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments,
allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means tested basis by this state, including
supplemental security income, low income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical
assistance, and general assistance:
                    (1) reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds
          from a loan and not income; and
                    (2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a
          borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
     (p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is
made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of
the following methods:
                    (1) at regular intervals;
                    (2) at regular intervals in which the amounts advanced may be reduced, for one or
          more advances, at the request of the borrower; or
                    (3) at any time by the lender, on behalf of the borrower, if the borrower fails to
          timely pay any of the following that the borrower is obligated to pay under the loan
          documents to the extent necessary to protect the lender's interest in or the value of
          the homestead property:
                              (A) taxes;
                              (B) insurance;

               is not an employee of the lender or a person or company that directly or
               indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the
               lender;
                              (D) assessments levied against the homestead property; and
                              (E) any lien that has, or may obtain, priority over the lender's lien as it is
               established in the loan documents.
     (q) To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section
41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on
homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit
described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent
that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner
provided for by this amendment.
     (r) The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure
proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section and to
foreclosure of a reverse mortgage lien that requires a court order.

availability, quality, and prices of financial services and research the practices of business entities
in the state that provide financial services under this section.  The director shall collect
information and produce reports on lending activity of those making loans under this section.  The
director shall report his or her findings to the legislature not later than December 1 of each year.

(q) If there is not enough money in the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans' Housing Assistance
Fund, or the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II, as the case may be, available to pay the
principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds benefitting those funds, including money
to make payments by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal of
or interest on the bonds, there is appropriated out of the first money coming into the treasury in
each fiscal year, not otherwise appropriated by this constitution, an amount that is sufficient to pay
the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds that mature or become due during that
fiscal year or to make bond enhancement payments with respect to those bonds.
(r) Receipts of all kinds of the Veterans' Land Fund, the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund, or
the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II that the Board determines are not required for the
payment of principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds benefitting those funds,
including payments by the Board under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal
of or interest on the bonds, may be used by the Board, to the extent not inconsistent with the
proceedings authorizing the bonds to:
(1) make temporary transfers to another of those funds to avoid a temporary cash deficiency in
that fund or make a transfer to another of those funds for the purposes of that fund;
(2) pay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued to provide money for
another of those funds or make bond enhancement payments with respect to the bonds; or
(3) pay the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the Board or make bond enhancement

furnish, or equip veterans homes.
(t) The revenue bonds shall be special obligations of the Board and payable only from and secured
only by receipts of the funds, assets transferred from the funds, and other revenues and assets as
determined by the Board and shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or the Veterans' Land
Board.  The Board may issue revenue bonds from time to time, which bonds may not exceed an
aggregate principal amount that the Board determines can be fully retired from the receipts of the
funds, the assets transferred from the funds, and the other revenues and assets pledged to the
retirement of the revenue bonds.  Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified by any other
provision of this constitution, revenue bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Board
determines.  A determination made by the Board under this subsection shall be binding and
conclusive as to the matter determined.
(u) The bonds authorized to be issued and sold by the Veterans' Land Board shall be issued and
sold in forms and denominations, on terms, at times, in the manner, at places, and in installments
the Board determines.  The bonds shall bear a rate or rates of interest the Board determines.  The
bonds shall be incontestable after execution by the Board, approval by the Attorney General of
Texas, and delivery to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds.
(v) This Amendment being intended only to establish a basic framework and not to be a
comprehensive treatment of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Program and the Veterans' Land
Program, there is hereby reposed in the Legislature full power to implement and effectuate the
design and objects of this Amendment, including the power to delegate such duties,
responsibilities, functions, and authority to the Veterans' Land Board as it believes necessary.
(w) In addition to the general obligation bonds authorized to be issued and to be sold by the
Veterans' Land Board by previous constitutional amendments, the Veterans' Land Board may
provide for, issue, and sell general obligation bonds of the state to provide home mortgage loans
to veterans of the state.  The principal amount of outstanding bonds authorized by this subsection
may not at any one time exceed $500 million.  The bond proceeds shall be deposited in or used to
benefit and augment the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II and shall be administered and
invested as provided by law.  Payments of principal and interest on the bonds, including payments
made under a bond enhancement agreement with respect to principal of or interest on the bonds,
shall be made from the sources and in the manner provided by this section for general obligation
bonds issued for the benefit of the Veterans' Housing Assistance Fund II.

DISTRIBUTION OF AVAILABLE SCHOOL FUND.  (a) The permanent school fund consists of
all land appropriated for public schools by this constitution or the other laws of this state, other
properties belonging to the permanent school fund, and all revenue derived from the land or other
properties. The available school fund consists of the distributions made to it from the total return
on all investment assets of the permanent school fund, the taxes authorized by this constitution or
general law to be part of the available school fund, and appropriations made to the available
school fund by the legislature. The total amount distributed from the permanent school fund to the
available school fund:
                    (1) in each year of a state fiscal biennium must be an amount that is not more than
          six percent of the average of the market value of the permanent school fund,
          excluding real property belonging to the fund that is managed, sold, or acquired
          under Section 4 of this article, on the last day of each of the 16 state fiscal quarters
          preceding the regular session of the legislature that begins before that state fiscal
          biennium, in accordance with the rate adopted by:
                              (A) a vote of two-thirds of the total membership of the State Board of
               Education, taken before the regular session of the legislature convenes; or
                              (B) the legislature by general law or appropriation, if the State Board of
               Education does not adopt a rate as provided by Paragraph (A) of this
               subdivision; and
                    (2) over the 10-year period consisting of the current state fiscal year and the nine
          preceding state fiscal years may not exceed the total return on all investment assets
          of the permanent school fund over the same 10-year period.
     (b) The expenses of managing permanent school fund land and investments shall be paid
by appropriation from the permanent school fund.
     (c) The available school fund shall be applied annually to the support of the public free
schools. Except as provided by this section, the legislature may not enact a law appropriating any
part of the permanent school fund or available school fund to any other purpose. The permanent
school fund and the available school fund may not be appropriated to or used for the support of
any sectarian school. The available school fund shall be distributed to the several counties
according to their scholastic population and applied in the manner provided by law.
     (d) The legislature by law may provide for using the permanent school fund to guarantee
bonds issued by school districts or by the state for the purpose of making loans to or purchasing
the bonds of school districts for the purpose of acquisition, construction, or improvement of
instructional facilities including all furnishings thereto. If any payment is required to be made by
the permanent school fund as a result of its guarantee of bonds issued by the state, an amount
equal to this payment shall be immediately paid by the state from the treasury to the permanent
school fund. An amount owed by the state to the permanent school fund under this section shall be
a general obligation of the state until paid. The amount of bonds authorized hereunder shall not
exceed $750 million or a higher amount authorized by a two-thirds record vote of both houses of
the legislature. If the proceeds of bonds issued by the state are used to provide a loan to a school
district and the district becomes delinquent on the loan payments, the amount of the delinquent
payments shall be offset against state aid to which the district is otherwise entitled.
     (e) The legislature may appropriate part of the available school fund for administration of
a bond guarantee program established under this section.
     (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, in managing the assets of the
permanent school fund, the State Board of Education may acquire, exchange, sell, supervise,
manage, or retain, through procedures and subject to restrictions it establishes and in amounts it
considers appropriate, any kind of investment, including investments in the Texas growth fund
created by Article XVI, Section 70, of this constitution, that persons of ordinary prudence,
discretion, and intelligence, exercising the judgment and care under the circumstances then
prevailing, acquire or retain for their own account in the management of their affairs, not in regard
to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income as well as the probable safety of their capital.
     (g) Notwithstanding Subsection (a) of this section, the total amount distributed from the
permanent school fund to the available school fund for the state fiscal years beginning September
1, 2003, and September 1, 2004, must be an amount equal to 4.5 percent of the average of the
market value of the permanent school fund, excluding real property belonging to the fund that is
managed, sold, or acquired under Section 4 of this article, on the last day of each of the 16 state
fiscal quarters preceding the regular session of the 78th Legislature.

     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision may provide for the taxation of all
property exempt under a law adopted under Subdivision (2) or (3) of Subsection (d) of this section

Sec. 1 b.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  (a) Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) of
the assessed taxable value of all residence homesteads of married or unmarried adults, male or
female, including those living alone, shall be exempt from all taxation for all State purposes.
     (b) The governing body of any county, city, town, school district, or other political
subdivision of the State may exempt by its own action not less than Three Thousand Dollars
($3,000) of the market value of residence homesteads of persons, married or unmarried, including
those living alone, who are under a disability for purposes of payment of disability insurance
benefits under Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance or its successor or of married
or unmarried persons sixty five (65) years of age or older, including those living alone, from all ad
valorem taxes thereafter levied by the political subdivision.  As an alternative, upon receipt of a
petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the voters who voted in the last preceding election held
by the political subdivision, the governing body of the subdivision shall call an election to
determine by majority vote whether an amount not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) as
provided in the petition, of the market value of residence homesteads of disabled persons or of
persons sixty five (65) years of age or over shall be exempt from ad valorem taxes thereafter
levied by the political subdivision.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age
or older may not receive both exemptions from the same political subdivision in the same year but
may choose either if the subdivision has adopted both.  Where any ad valorem tax has theretofore
been pledged for the payment of any debt, the taxing officers of the political subdivision shall
have authority to continue to levy and collect the tax against the homestead property at the same
rate as the tax so pledged until the debt is discharged, if the cessation of the levy would impair the
obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.
     (c) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of
a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone, is exempt from ad valorem taxation for
general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The legislature by general law may
provide that all or part of the exemption does not apply to a district or political subdivision that
imposes ad valorem taxes for public education purposes but is not the principal school district
providing general elementary and secondary public education throughout its territory.  In addition
to this exemption, the legislature by general law may exempt an amount not to exceed Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000) of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is
disabled as defined in Subsection (b) of this section and of a person sixty five (65) years of age or
older from ad valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes.  The
legislature by general law may base the amount of and condition eligibility for the additional
exemption authorized by this subsection for disabled persons and for persons sixty five (65) years
of age or older on economic need.  An eligible disabled person who is sixty five (65) years of age
or older may not receive both exemptions from a school district but may choose either.  An
eligible person is entitled to receive both the exemption required by this subsection for all
residence homesteads and any exemption adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section, but
the legislature shall provide by general law whether an eligible disabled or elderly person may
receive both the additional exemption for the elderly and disabled authorized by this subsection
and any exemption for the elderly or disabled adopted pursuant to Subsection (b) of this section. 
Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for the payment of debt, the taxing officers of
a school district may continue to levy and collect the tax against the value of homesteads
exempted under this subsection until the debt is discharged if the cessation of the levy would
impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.  The legislature shall provide
for formulas to protect school districts against all or part of the revenue loss incurred by the
implementation of Article VIII, Sections 1 b(c), 1 b(d), and 1 d 1, of this constitution.  The
legislature by general law may define residence homestead for purposes of this section.
     (d) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if a person receives a residence
homestead exemption prescribed by Subsection (c) of this section for homesteads of persons who
are sixty five (65) years of age or older or who are disabled, the total amount of ad valorem taxes
imposed on that homestead for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not
be increased while it remains the residence homestead of that person or that person's spouse who
receives the exemption.  If a person sixty five (65) years of age or older dies in a year in which the
person received the exemption, the total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead
for general elementary and secondary public school purposes may not be increased while it
remains the residence homestead of that person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty five (55)
years of age or older at the time of the person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by
general law.  The legislature, by general law, may provide for the transfer of all or a proportionate
amount of a limitation provided by this subsection for a person who qualifies for the limitation
and establishes a different residence homestead.  However, taxes otherwise limited by this
subsection may be increased to the extent the value of the homestead is increased by
improvements other than repairs or improvements made to comply with governmental
requirements and except as may be consistent with the transfer of a limitation under this
subsection.  For a residence homestead subject to the limitation provided by this subsection in the
1996 tax year or an earlier tax year, the legislature shall provide for a reduction in the amount of
the limitation for the 1997 tax year and subsequent tax years in an amount equal to $10,000
multiplied by the 1997 tax rate for general elementary and secondary public school purposes
applicable to the residence homestead.
     (e) The governing body of a political subdivision, other than a county education district,
may exempt from ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence
homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone.  In the manner provided by
law, the voters of a county education district at an election held for that purpose may exempt from
ad valorem taxation a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a married or
unmarried adult, including one living alone.  The percentage may not exceed twenty percent. 
However, the amount of an exemption authorized pursuant to this subsection may not be less than
Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) unless the legislature by general law prescribes other monetary
restrictions on the amount of the exemption.  An eligible adult is entitled to receive other
applicable exemptions provided by law.  Where ad valorem tax has previously been pledged for
the payment of debt, the governing body of a political subdivision may continue to levy and
collect the tax against the value of the homesteads exempted under this subsection until the debt is
discharged if the cessation of the levy would impair the obligation of the contract by which the
debt was created.  The legislature by general law may prescribe procedures for the administration
of residence homestead exemptions.
     (e 1) (Added Nov. 3, 1981; expired Jan. 2, 1982.)
     (f) The surviving spouse of a person who received an exemption under Subsection (b) of
this section for the residence homestead of a person sixty five (65) years of age or older is entitled
to an exemption for the same property from the same political subdivision in an amount equal to
that of the exemption received by the deceased spouse if the deceased spouse died in a year in
which the deceased spouse received the exemption, the surviving spouse was fifty five (55) years
of age or older when the deceased spouse died, and the property was the residence homestead of
the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence homestead of the
surviving spouse.  A person who receives an exemption under Subsection (b) of this section is not
entitled to an exemption under this subsection.  The legislature by general law may prescribe
procedures for the administration of this subsection.
     (g) If the legislature provides for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a tax
limitation provided by Subsection (d) of this section for a person who qualifies for the limitation
and subsequently establishes a different residence homestead, the legislature by general law may
authorize the governing body of a school district to elect to apply the law providing for the
transfer of the tax limitation to a change of a person's residence homestead that occurred before
that law took effect, subject to any restrictions provided by general law.  The transfer of the
limitation may apply only to taxes imposed in a tax year that begins after the tax year in which the
election is made.
     (h) The governing body of a county, a city or town, or a junior college district by official
action may provide that if a person who is disabled or is sixty-five (65) years of age or older
receives a residence homestead exemption prescribed or authorized by this section, the total
amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on that homestead by the county, the city or town, or the
junior college district may not be increased while it remains the residence homestead of that
person or that person's spouse who is disabled or sixty-five (65) years of age or older and receives
a residence homestead exemption on the homestead. As an alternative, on receipt of a petition
signed by five percent (5%) of the registered voters of the county, the city or town, or the junior
college district, the governing body of the county, the city or town, or the junior college district
shall call an election to determine by majority vote whether to establish a tax limitation provided
by this subsection. If a county, a city or town, or a junior college district establishes a tax
limitation provided by this subsection and a disabled person or a person sixty-five (65) years of
age or older dies in a year in which the person received a residence homestead exemption, the
total amount of ad valorem taxes imposed on the homestead by the county, the city or town, or the
junior college district may not be increased while it remains the residence homestead of that
person's surviving spouse if the spouse is fifty-five (55) years of age or older at the time of the
person's death, subject to any exceptions provided by general law. The legislature, by general law,
may provide for the transfer of all or a proportionate amount of a tax limitation provided by this
subsection for a person who qualifies for the limitation and establishes a different residence
homestead within the same county, within the same city or town, or within the same junior college
district. A county, a city or town, or a junior college district that establishes a tax limitation under
this subsection must comply with a law providing for the transfer of the limitation, even if the
legislature enacts the law subsequent to the county's, the city's or town's, or the junior college
district's establishment of the limitation. Taxes otherwise limited by a county, a city or town, or a
junior college district under this subsection may be increased to the extent the value of the
homestead is increased by improvements other than repairs and other than improvements made to
comply with governmental requirements and except as may be consistent with the transfer of a tax
limitation under a law authorized by this subsection. The governing body of a county, a city or
town, or a junior college district may not repeal or rescind a tax limitation established under this
subsection.

Sec. 2.  OCCUPATION TAXES; EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY; EXEMPTIONS FROM
TAXATION.  (a) All occupation taxes shall be equal and uniform upon the same class of subjects
within the limits of the authority levying the tax; but the legislature may, by general laws, exempt
from taxation public property used for public purposes; actual places of religious worship, also
any property owned by a church or by a strictly religious society for the exclusive use as a
dwelling place for the ministry of such church or religious society, and which yields no revenue
whatever to such church or religious society; provided that such exemption shall not extend to
more property than is reasonably necessary for a dwelling place and in no event more than one
acre of land; any property owned by a church or by a strictly religious society that owns an actual
place of religious worship if the property is owned for the purpose of expansion of the place of
religious worship or construction of a new place of religious worship and the property yields no
revenue whatever to the church or religious society, provided that the legislature by general law
may provide eligibility limitations for the exemption and may impose sanctions related to the
exemption in furtherance of the taxation policy of this subsection; any property that is owned by a
church or by a strictly religious society and is leased by that church or strictly religious society to a
person for use as a school, as defined by Section 11.21, Tax Code, or a successor statute, for
educational purposes; places of burial not held for private or corporate profit; solar or wind
powered energy devices; all buildings used exclusively and owned by persons or associations of

invested in bonds or mortgages, or in land or other property which has been and shall hereafter be
bought in by such institutions under foreclosure sales made to satisfy or protect such bonds or
mortgages, that such exemption of such land and property shall continue only for two years after
the purchase of the same at such sale by such institutions and no longer, and institutions engaged

charitable functions; and all laws exempting property from taxation other than the property
mentioned in this Section shall be null and void.
     (b) The Legislature may, by general law, exempt property owned by a disabled veteran or
by the surviving spouse and surviving minor children of a disabled veteran.  A disabled veteran is
a veteran of the armed services of the United States who is classified as disabled by the Veterans'
Administration or by a successor to that agency; or the military service in which he served.  A
veteran who is certified as having a disability of less than 10 percent is not entitled to an

exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $12,000.  The spouse and children of any
member of the United States Armed Forces who dies while on active duty may be granted an
exemption from taxation for property valued at up to $5,000.  A deceased disabled veteran's
surviving spouse and children may be granted an exemption which in the aggregate is equal to the
exemption to which the veteran was entitled when the veteran died.
     (c) The Legislature by general law may exempt from ad valorem taxation property that is
owned by a nonprofit organization composed primarily of members or former members of the
armed forces of the United States or its allies and chartered or incorporated by the United States
Congress.
     (d) Unless otherwise provided by general law enacted after January 1, 1995, the amounts
of the exemptions from ad valorem taxation to which a person is entitled under Section 11.22, Tax
Code, for a tax year that begins on or after the date this subsection takes effect are the maximum
amounts permitted under Subsection (b) of this section instead of the amounts specified by
Section 11.22, Tax Code.  This subsection may be repealed by the Legislature by general law.

          TEXAS CONSTITUTION. YOUR RIGHTS ARE GOVERNED BY SECTION
          50, ARTICLE XVI, OF THE TEXAS CONSTITUTION, AND NOT BY THIS
          NOTICE."
     If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than
English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into
the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
     (h) A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment as
to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection
(a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
                    (1) the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation
          prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an
          extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
                    (2) the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the
          payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair market
          value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
     (i) This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages
from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value
without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit
described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit with
homestead property if:
                    (1) the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure
          that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by
          Section 50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
                    (2) the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the
          foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
                    (3) the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
     (j) Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e) (i) of this section are not severable, and none of
those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held
to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This
subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and before
the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e) (i) is held to be preempted.
     (k) "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
                    (1) that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written
          agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
                    (2) that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 62 years or older;
                    (3) that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the
          spouse of each owner;
                    (4) under which advances are provided to a borrower based on the equity in a
          borrower's homestead;
                    (5) that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances
          because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
                    (6) that requires no payment of principal or interest until:
                              (A) all borrowers have died;
                              (B) the homestead property securing the loan is sold or otherwise
               transferred;
                              (C) all borrowers cease occupying the homestead property for a period of
               longer than 12 consecutive months without prior written approval from the
               lender; or
                              (D) the borrower:
                                        (i) defaults on an obligation specified in the loan documents to
                    repair and maintain, pay taxes and assessments on, or insure the
                    homestead property;
                                        (ii) commits actual fraud in connection with the loan; or
                                        (iii) fails to maintain the priority of the lender's lien on the
                    homestead property, after the lender gives notice to the borrower, by
                    promptly discharging any lien that has priority or may obtain
                    priority over the lender's lien within 10 days after the date the
                    borrower receives the notice, unless the borrower:
                                                  (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured
                         by the lien in a manner acceptable to the lender;
                                                  (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against
                         enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings so as to prevent
                         the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the
                         homestead property; or
                                                  (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement
                         satisfactory to the lender subordinating the lien to all
                         amounts secured by the lender's lien on the homestead
                         property;
                    (7) that provides that if the lender fails to make loan advances as required in the
          loan documents and if the lender fails to cure the default as required in the loan
          documents after notice from the borrower, the lender forfeits all principal and
          interest of the reverse mortgage, provided, however, that this subdivision does not
          apply when a governmental agency or instrumentality takes an assignment of the
          loan in order to cure the default;
                    (8) that is not made unless the owner of the homestead attests in writing that the
          owner received counseling regarding the advisability and availability of reverse
          mortgages and other financial alternatives;
                    (9) that requires the lender, at the time the loan is made, to disclose to the borrower
          by written notice the specific provisions contained in Subdivision (6) of this
          subsection under which the borrower is required to repay the loan;
                    (10) that does not permit the lender to commence foreclosure until the lender gives
          notice to the borrower, in the manner provided for a notice by mail related to the
          foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section, that a ground for
          foreclosure exists and gives the borrower at least 30 days, or at least 20 days in the
          event of a default under Subdivision (6)(D)(iii) of this subsection, to:
                              (A) remedy the condition creating the ground for foreclosure;
                              (B) pay the debt secured by the homestead property from proceeds of the
               sale of the homestead property by the borrower or from any other sources;
               or
                              (C) convey the homestead property to the lender by a deed in lieu of
               foreclosure; and
                    (11) that is secured by a lien that may be foreclosed upon only by a court order, if
          the foreclosure is for a ground other than a ground stated by Subdivision (6)(A) or
          (B) of this subsection.
     (l)  Advances made under a reverse mortgage and interest on those advances have priority
over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead property
is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of that county.
     (m) A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and may
also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the
homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a
reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be
compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
     (n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be
made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:
                    (1) a limitation on the purpose and use of future advances or other mortgage
          proceeds;
                    (2) a limitation on future advances to a term of years or a limitation on the term of
          open end account advances;
                    (3) a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over
          intervening advances;
                    (4) a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage
          loan documents;
                    (5) a prohibition on balloon payments;
                    (6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
                    (7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest
          authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of
          interest; and
                    (8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced
          before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.
     (o) For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments,
allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means tested basis by this state, including
supplemental security income, low income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical
assistance, and general assistance:
                    (1) reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds
          from a loan and not income; and
                    (2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a
          borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
     (p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is
made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of
the following methods:
                    (1) at regular intervals;
                    (2) at regular intervals in which the amounts advanced may be reduced, for one or
          more advances, at the request of the borrower; or
                    (3) at any time by the lender, on behalf of the borrower, if the borrower fails to
          timely pay any of the following that the borrower is obligated to pay under the loan
          documents to the extent necessary to protect the lender's interest in or the value of
          the homestead property:
                              (A) taxes;
                              (B) insurance;
                              (C) costs of repairs or maintenance performed by a person or company that
               is not an employee of the lender or a person or company that directly or
               indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the
               lender;
                              (D) assessments levied against the homestead property; and
                              (E) any lien that has, or may obtain, priority over the lender's lien as it is
               established in the loan documents.
     (q) To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section
41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on
homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit
described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent
that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner
provided for by this amendment.
     (r) The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure
proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section and to
foreclosure of a reverse mortgage lien that requires a court order.
     (s) The Finance Commission of Texas shall appoint a director to conduct research on the
availability, quality, and prices of financial services and research the practices of business entities
in the state that provide financial services under this section.  The director shall collect
information and produce reports on lending activity of those making loans under this section.  The
director shall report his or her findings to the legislature not later than December 1 of each year.
     (t) A home equity line of credit is a form of an open-end account that may be debited from
time to time, under which credit may be extended from time to time and under which:
                    (1) the owner requests advances, repays money, and reborrows money;
                    (2) any single debit or advance is not less than $4,000;
                    (3) the owner does not use a credit card, debit card, preprinted solicitation check,
          or similar device to obtain an advance;
                    (4) any fees described by Subsection (a)(6)(E) of this section are charged and
          collected only at the time the extension of credit is established and no fee is
          charged or collected in connection with any debit or advance;
                    (5) the maximum principal amount that may be extended under the account, when
          added to the aggregate total of the outstanding principal balances of all
          indebtedness secured by the homestead on the date the extension of credit is
          established, does not exceed an amount described under Subsection (a)(6)(B) of
          this section;
                    (6) no additional debits or advances are made if the total principal amount
          outstanding exceeds an amount equal to 50 percent of the fair market value of the
          homestead as determined on the date the account is established;
                    (7) the lender or holder may not unilaterally amend the extension of credit; and
                    (8) repayment is to be made in regular periodic installments, not more often than
          every 14 days and not less often than monthly, beginning not later than two months
          from the date the extension of credit is established, and:
                              (A) during the period during which the owner may request advances, each
               installment equals or exceeds the amount of accrued interest; and
                              (B) after the period during which the owner may request advances,
               installments are substantially equal.
     (u) The legislature may by statute delegate one or more state agencies the power to
interpret Subsections (a)(5)-(a)(7), (e)-(p), and (t), of this section. An act or omission does not
violate a provision included in those subsections if the act or omission conforms to an
interpretation of the provision that is:
                    (1) in effect at the time of the act or omission; and
                    (2) made by a state agency to which the power of interpretation is delegated as
          provided by this subsection or by an appellate court of this state or the United
          States.

Sec. 59.  CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND
PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES; CONSERVATION AND RECLAMATION
DISTRICTS.  (a) The conservation and development of all of the natural resources of this State,
and development of parks and recreational facilities, including the control, storing, preservation
and distribution of its storm and flood waters, the waters of its rivers and streams, for irrigation,
power and all other useful purposes, the reclamation and irrigation of its arid, semiarid and other
lands needing irrigation, the reclamation and drainage of its overflowed lands, and other lands
needing drainage, the conservation and development of its forests, water and hydro electric power,
the navigation of its inland and coastal waters, and the preservation and conservation of all such
natural resources of the State are each and all hereby declared public rights and duties; and the
Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.
     (b) There may be created within the State of Texas, or the State may be divided into, such
number of conservation and reclamation districts as may be determined to be essential to the
accomplishment of the purposes of this amendment to the constitution, which districts shall be
governmental agencies and bodies politic and corporate with such powers of government and with
the authority to exercise such rights, privileges and functions concerning the subject matter of this
amendment as may be conferred by law.
     (c) The Legislature shall authorize all such indebtedness as may be necessary to provide all
improvements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement of the purposes of this
amendment.  All such indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of such conservation and
reclamation districts, to be issued under such regulations as may be prescribed by law.  The
Legislature shall also authorize the levy and collection within such districts of all such taxes,
equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment of the interest and the creation of a
sinking fund for the payment of such bonds and for the maintenance of such districts and
improvements.  Such indebtedness shall be a lien upon the property assessed for the payment
thereof.  The Legislature shall not authorize the issuance of any bonds or provide for any
indebtedness against any reclamation district unless such proposition shall first be submitted to
the qualified voters of such district and the proposition adopted.
     (c-1) In addition and only as provided by this subsection, the Legislature may authorize
conservation and reclamation districts to develop and finance with taxes those types and
categories of parks and recreational facilities that were not authorized by this section to be
developed and financed with taxes before September 13, 2003. For development of such parks
and recreational facilities, the Legislature may authorize indebtedness payable from taxes as may
be necessary to provide for improvements and maintenance only for a conservation and
reclamation district all or part of which is located in Bexar County, Bastrop County, Waller
County, Travis County, Williamson County, Harris County, Galveston County, Brazoria County,
Fort Bend County, or Montgomery County, or for the Tarrant Regional Water District, a water
control and improvement district located in whole or in part in Tarrant County. All the
indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of the conservation and reclamation district, to be issued
under regulations as may be prescribed by law. The Legislature may also authorize the levy and
collection within such district of all taxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the
payment of the interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of the bonds and for
maintenance of and improvements to such parks and recreational facilities. The indebtedness shall
be a lien on the property assessed for the payment of the bonds. The Legislature may not authorize
the issuance of bonds or provide for indebtedness under this subsection against a conservation and
reclamation district unless a proposition is first submitted to the qualified voters of the district and
the proposition is adopted. This subsection expands the authority of the Legislature with respect to
certain conservation and reclamation districts and is not a limitation on the authority of the
Legislature with respect to conservation and reclamation districts and parks and recreational
facilities pursuant to this section as that authority existed before September 13, 2003. 
     (d) No law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall be passed unless notice of
the intention to introduce such a bill setting forth the general substance of the contemplated  law
shall have been published at least thirty (30) days and not more than ninety (90) days prior to the
introduction thereof in a newspaper or newspapers having general circulation  in the county or
counties in which said district or any part thereof is or will be located and by delivering a copy of
such notice and such bill to the Governor who shall submit such notice and bill to the Texas
Water Commission, or its successor, which shall file its recommendation as to such bill with the
Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House of Representatives within thirty (30)
days from date notice was received by the Texas Water Commission.  Such notice and copy of bill
shall also be given of the introduction of any bill amending a law creating or governing a
particular conservation and reclamation district if such bill (1) adds additional land to the district,
(2) alters the taxing authority of the district, (3) alters the authority of the district with respect to
the issuance of  bonds, or (4) alters the qualifications or terms of office of the members of the
governing body of the district.
     (e) No law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall be passed unless, at the
time notice of the intention to introduce a bill is published as provided in Subsection (d) of this
section, a copy of the proposed bill is delivered to the commissioners court of each county in
which said district or any part thereof is or will be located and to the governing body of each
incorporated city or town in whose jurisdiction said district or any part thereof is or will be
located.  Each such commissioners court and governing body may file its written consent or
opposition to the creation of the proposed district with the governor, lieutenant governor, and
speaker of the house of representatives.  Each special law creating a conservation and reclamation
district shall comply with the provisions of the general laws then in effect relating to consent by
political subdivisions to the creation of conservation and reclamation districts and to the inclusion
of land within the district.
     (f) A conservation and reclamation district created under this section to perform any or all
of the purposes of this section may engage in fire fighting activities and may issue bonds or other
indebtedness for fire fighting purposes as provided by law and this constitution.

Sec. 66.  PROTECTED BENEFITS UNDER CERTAIN PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. 
(a) This section applies only to a public retirement system that is not a statewide system and that
provides service and disability retirement benefits and death benefits to public officers and
employees.
(b) This section does not apply to a public retirement system that provides service and disability
retirement benefits and death benefits to firefighters and police officers employed by the City of
San Antonio.
(c) This section does not apply to benefits that are:
(1) health benefits;
(2) life insurance benefits; or
(3) disability benefits that a retirement system determines are no longer payable under the terms of
the retirement system as those terms existed on the date the retirement system began paying the
disability benefits.
(d) On or after the effective date of this section, a change in service or disability retirement
benefits or death benefits of a retirement system may not reduce or otherwise impair benefits
accrued by a person if the person:
(1) could have terminated employment or has terminated employment before the effective date of
the change; and
(2) would have been eligible for those benefits, without accumulating additional service under the
retirement system, on any date on or after the effective date of the change had the change not
occurred.
(e) Benefits granted to a retiree or other annuitant before the effective date of this section and in
effect on that date may not be reduced or otherwise impaired.
(f) The political subdivision or subdivisions and the retirement system that finance benefits under
the retirement system are jointly responsible for ensuring that benefits under this section are not
reduced or otherwise impaired.
(g) This section does not create a liability or an obligation to a retirement system for a member of
the retirement system other than the payment by active members of a required contribution or a
future required contribution to the retirement system.
(h) A retirement system described by Subsection (a) and the political subdivision or subdivisions
that finance benefits under the retirement system are exempt from the application of this section
if:
(1) the political subdivision or subdivisions hold an election on the date in May 2004 that political
subdivisions may use for the election of their officers;
(2) the majority of the voters of a political subdivision voting at the election favor exempting the

Sec. 72.  TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT OF PUBLIC OFFICER ON MILITARY ACTIVE
DUTY.  (a) An elected or appointed officer of the state or of any political subdivision who enters
active duty in the armed forces of the United States as a result of being called to duty, drafted, or
activated does not vacate the office held, but the appropriate authority may appoint a replacement
to serve as temporary acting officer as provided by this section if the elected or appointed officer
will be on active duty for longer than 30 days.
(b) For an officer other than a member of the legislature, the authority who has the power to

acting officer for a state or district office, and the governing body of a political subdivision may
appoint the temporary acting officer for an office of that political subdivision.
(c) For an officer who is a member of the legislature, the member of the legislature shall select a
person to serve as the temporary acting representative or senator, subject to approval of the
selection by a majority vote of the appropriate house of the legislature. The temporary acting
representative or senator must be:
(1) a member of the same political party as the member being temporarily replaced; and
(2) qualified for office under Section 6, Article III, of this constitution for a senator, or Section 7,
Article III, of this constitution for a representative.
(d) The officer who is temporarily replaced under this section may recommend to the appropriate
appointing authority the name of a person to temporarily fill the office.
(e) The appropriate authority shall appoint the temporary acting officer to begin service on the
date specified in writing by the officer being temporarily replaced as the date the officer will enter
active military service.
(f) A temporary acting officer has all the powers, privileges, and duties of the office and is entitled
to the same compensation, payable in the same manner and from the same source, as the officer
who is temporarily replaced.
(g) A temporary acting officer appointed under this section shall perform the duties of office for
the shorter period of:
(1) the term of the active military service of the officer who is temporarily replaced; or
(2) the term of office of the officer who is temporarily replaced.
(h) In this section, "armed forces of the United States" means the United States Army, the United
States Navy, the United States Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Coast
Guard, any reserve or auxiliary component of any of those services, or the National Guard.
