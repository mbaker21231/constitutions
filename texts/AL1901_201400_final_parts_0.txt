The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted for improvements at the Alabama state
docks and the refunding of state docks revenue bonds, and in evidence of the indebtedness so
incurred to issue and sell, in addition to all other bonds of the state, interest bearing general
obligation bonds of the state not exceeding ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in principal amount.
The full faith and credit and taxing power of the state are hereby pledged to the prompt and
faithful payment of the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon. The Alabama state docks
department (which term as used herein shall be construed to include any other agency of the state
that may succeed to said department's functions) shall pledge and use so much of the revenues
derived from its seaport facilities as may be necessary to pay at their maturities the principal of
and interest on said bonds, and may pledge, agree to use, and use so much of said revenues as the
said department with the approval of the governor may determine shall be necessary or desirable
to build up and maintain a reserve for the payment of said principal and interest and for the
maintenance, replacement and improvement of its seaport facilities.

The proceeds from the sale of any such bonds shall, after payment of the reasonable and
necessary expenses of their issuance, be set aside in a special fund in the state treasury and shall
be paid out of the Alabama state docks department upon authorization by the governor and shall
be held by the said department in a special trust fund designated "state docks bond fund" and
therefrom be disbursed as follows:

(a) Not exceeding $3,000,000 may be used to pay the reasonable and necessary costs of
constructing and equipping works of internal improvement for use and operation as a part of the
state docks facilities; provided that, if said department shall have issued subsequent to July 1,
1963, any notes in anticipation of the sale of bonds for any of said purposes, then so much as may
be necessary, not exceeding $1,000,000, of said $3,000,000 shall be used to retire or fund said
notes; and

(b) Not exceeding $7,000,000 may be used to refund and provide for the retirement of all or such
part of the outstanding revenue bonds heretofore issued by said department as the director
thereof, with the approval of the governor, shall deem advantageous, including payment of any
redemption premiums required under the terms of said outstanding bonds to be paid in order to
effect redemption thereof prior to their maturities; provided, that pending any redemption date
or dates on which the outstanding bonds so refunded can be redeemed under their terms, any part
of said $7,000,000 and any other funds of the said department may be invested in securities that
are direct obligations of the United States of America, and such securities may be deposited by
said department under irrevocable trust agreements, which said department is hereby authorized
to enter into with any corporate trustee, and used to pay principal, interest and redemption
premiums on said outstanding bonds.

Alabama state docks department is hereby vested with full authority, except as limited herein, to
prescribe the terms of the bonds and to provide for the issuance and sale thereof. The bonds may
be sold, executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may be in such forms,
denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or
dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, with rights of
conversion into another form, may be payable in such installments and at such place or places,
may bear interest at such rate or rates, payable and evidenced in such manner, and may contain
provisions for redemption at the option of the state to be exercised by the state docks department
at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or
prices, all as shall be provided by the said department in the order or orders under which the
bonds are issued. The principal of each series of bonds shall mature in annual installments in
such amounts as shall be specified in the authorizing order or orders, the first of which
installments shall mature not later than one year after the date of the bonds of such series and the
last of which installments shall mature not later than twenty years after the date of the bonds of
the same series. The largest installment of principal and interest maturing on each series of the
bonds in any one year shall not exceed twice the preceding smallest installment of principal and
interest maturing thereon in any prior year. None of the bonds shall be sold for less than
face value plus accrued interest thereon to the date of delivery. The bonds shall be sold only at
public sale or sales, either on sealed bids or at auction, after such advertisement as may be
prescribed by the said department to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to
the state computed to the respective maturities of the bonds sold; provided, that if no bid deemed
acceptable by the said department is received all bids may be rejected.

The bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the governor and countersigned by the state
docks director, and the great seal of the state of Alabama or a facsimile thereof shall be
impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and shall be attested by the signature of the
secretary of state; provided, that facsimile signatures of any one or any two (but not all) of said
officers may be reproduced on any of such bonds in lieu of being manually signed thereon.
Coupons attached to the bonds and representing installments of interest thereon shall be signed
with the facsimile signature of the state treasurer, which facsimile signature shall constitute due
and sufficient authentication of said coupons.

All bonds issued under the provisions of this amendment, together with the interest income
thereon, shall forever be exempt from taxation in this state.

The authorization to incur debt and issue bonds contained in this amendment shall supersede and
take the place of any authorization for Alabama state docks department to issue revenue bonds
granted by act of the legislature on the effective date of this amendment.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing and authorization from or other action

precincts numbered one through seven; provided that the time during which such tax is to

electors of said election precincts numbered one through seven, requesting that such election be
called. The governing body may call such election to be held at the same time that this
amendment is submitted to the electors of the state for ratification and such election shall be

ratified. The notice of such election, ballots to be used at such election and procedures for
holding and determining the results of such election shall be prescribed by the governing body of

election so held.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by

therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by
issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates
of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient
amount of the annual
proceeds from said tax received by the county. 
The governing body of Baldwin county shall have power to designate as the agency of the
county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said
election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter
organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so
designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it
for any one or
more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the
proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result
in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said
public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by
issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds,
warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of
the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax
so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin county under the authority of this amendment,
which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts
made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this
amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin county or of a political subdivision
thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute
an
indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities

solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto
pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are
made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and
maintaining any public hospital facilities.

As used in this article, the term "election precincts" means the election precincts or beats of the

and collected for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax year beginning October 1,
1977, with the first year's tax being payable October 1, 1978; provided such tax and the time it is
to continue shall have been first submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the school
district in which such tax is to be collected, and voted for by a majority of those voting at such
election; otherwise said tax shall not be collected. A special separate election is hereby called on

special school tax,
such school tax shall, commencing with the tax year beginning October 1, 1977, be levied and
collected as other property taxes in said school district are levied and collected for a period of
thirty years. If the proceeds of the tax are pledged to the payment of the principal and interest of

thereof, pay such proceeds to the city of Anniston, and if the proceeds of the tax are not so
pledged, he shall pay such proceeds to the board of education of the city of Anniston. This
section shall be self-executing.

such request may be made prior to October 1, 1977, the city of Anniston shall, as and when
requested by the board of education of Anniston, issue and sell interest bearing bonds, with
principal and interest to be paid from the proceeds to be derived from said special
school tax, for the sole purpose of construction and improvement of school buildings within such
school tax district, and acquiring sites therefor. The net proceeds of the sale of such bonds shall
be immediately paid to the board of education of the city of Anniston. The proceeds to be derived
from said special school tax may be pledged by the city of Anniston for the payment of said
bonds and the interest thereon, but said bonds shall not be a general obligation of the city of
Anniston or of Calhoun county, and shall not be charged to the constitutional debt limit of the
city of Anniston or of Calhoun county.

(C) Except as herein otherwise provided the election hereinabove provided for shall be called,
held and conducted as provided for by law for the calling, holding and conducting of district
school tax elections; provided, however, that the governing body of the city of Anniston shall call
said election, it shall give at least thirty days' notice thereof by publication in some newspaper

city for at least thirty days prior to said election, it shall appoint and designate the officers,
managers, clerks and returning officers to conduct said election, it shall furnish the supplies and

The legislature may provide for the formation of districts in Jefferson county, Alabama, for
establishing and maintaining a system for fighting or preventing fires or for the collection and
disposal of garbage and trash; provided, however, that no territory lying within the limits of a
municipal corporation at the time of the establishment of any such district shall be included
within such district; and, provided further, that no such district shall be established unless the
establishment thereof has been first approved by the qualified electors residing within the
proposed district at an election held as provided for by a law or laws adopted by the legislature. A
district may be established for either or both of the aforesaid purposes. The legislature
may provide for submitting to the qualified electors residing within the proposed district the
question of whether the district shall be created to establish and maintain a firefighting and fire
prevention system, or the question of whether the district shall be created to establish and
maintain a garbage collection and garbage disposal system; and to provide that the two questions
may be submitted separately at the same election. 

The expenses of establishing and maintaining any such firefighting and fire prevention system or
any such garbage collection and disposal system in a district, as the case may be, shall be paid for
exclusively by the proceeds of a service charge, which shall be levied and collected in an amount
sufficient to pay the said expenses.

No service charge shall be levied unless the same has been first approved at an election by the
qualified electors residing within the district, or in the proposed district if the question of the levy
of the service charge is submitted simultaneously with the question of whether the district shall
be created.

Said service charges shall be levied upon and collected from the persons and property to whom
and to which such services are available; and the service charge shall be a lien upon any such
property.

The legislature may provide for the enlargement of a district by the addition of territory thereto,
subject to the following conditions: (1) No territory lying within a municipal corporation at the
time the additional territory is brought within the district shall be included; (2) no territory shall
be added unless the qualified electors of the territory to be added have approved the inclusion of
said territory within the district at an election held for that purpose within the territory proposed
to
be added; (3) no territory shall be added unless the majority of the electors residing within the
territory proposed to be added have first approved at an election held within such territory every
service charge in effect within the district at the time the said addition is proposed.

The legislature shall have the authority to adopt laws providing for the administration of the
affairs of the district by the governing body of the county or by an agency of the county.

The legislature may provide for the issuance of bonds for such districts with or without an
election; provided, however, that all bonds issued hereunder shall be payable only out of the
proceeds of the service charge authorized hereby, and no such bond shall be a general obligation

fund).

Amendment of Amendment No. 195.

Special Tax for Public Hospital Purposes in Mobile County.

A The following terms, wherever used in this amendment, shall be given the respective meanings
hereinafter set forth. "The special tax" means the special county tax herein provided for. "The
board" means Mobile county public hospital board, a public corporation existing under Act No.
46 adopted at the 1949 regular session of the legislature of Alabama, as amended. "Public
hospital facilities" means public hospitals of all types, public clinics, public health centers,
related public
health facilities such as laboratories, outpatient departments, nurses' homes, and nurses' training
facilities and other facilities operated in connection with public hospitals. "Public hospital
purposes" means the acquisition by purchase, lease, donation or otherwise, and the construction,
equipment, operation and maintenance of public hospital facilities, including the treatment
and care of indigent patients.

B If authorized by the vote of the majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county who
participate in any election called for the purpose, the governing body of Mobile county must,
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this amendment, levy and collect, in addition
to all other taxes authorized by law, a special annual ad valorem county tax at a rate
not exceeding six mills on each dollar of taxable property in Mobile county, the proceeds from
which shall be used solely for public hospital purposes.

C If a majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county participating in the election on the
adoption of this amendment shall vote for adoption of this amendment, then the approval of this
amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the special
tax and in that event no additional election by the voters of Mobile county shall be required
to authorize the levy of the special tax. If the majority vote at any election held hereunder is not
in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall be voted at a rate of
less than six mills on each dollar of taxable property in Mobile county, then the governing body
of Mobile county may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of
the special tax or on the increase of the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding six mills on each
dollar of taxable property, and must call any such election within three months after the receipt
by the said governing body of a petition for the calling of such election signed by not less than
five percent of the qualified electors of Mobile county; provided, however, that not more than
one election upon the levy of the special tax or upon the increase in the rate thereof, up to but not
exceeding six mills as aforesaid, shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months.
After the special tax shall have been levied for a period of five years, the governing body of
Mobile county may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the question of
the discontinuance of the tax or a reduction in the rate thereof, such discontinuance or reduction
to become effective for the tax year of the county next succeeding the tax year during which any
obligations of the board that may be outstanding at the time of the election and that are payable
out of or secured by any part of the special tax shall be finally retired; and after said five year
period, the said governing body must call an election on the question of said discontinuance or
reduction within three months after receipt by the said governing body of a petition for such
election signed by not less than five percent of the qualified electors of Mobile county. If a
majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county voting in any election upon the
discontinuance of the special tax or reduction of the rate thereof should vote in favor of such
discontinuance or reduction, then the special tax shall be discontinued or its rate reduced, as the
case may be, such discontinuance or reduction to become effective for the tax year next
succeeding the tax year when any of the aforesaid obligations outstanding at the time of the
election shall be retired; provided, however, that not more than one election upon the
discontinuance of the special tax or a reduction in the rate thereof shall be held during any period
of twelve consecutive months. If the special tax shall be discontinued or its rate reduced pursuant
to any election held hereunder, its levy or an increase in its rate up to the aforesaid maximum of
six mills may be authorized at a subsequent election or elections held hereunder, and the special
tax may thereafter again be discontinued or reduced in rate pursuant to subsequent election or
elections held hereunder, it being the intention hereof that the power of the governing body of
Mobile county to call elections hereunder, and its duty to call them upon receipt of petition as
herein provided, shall be continuous, subject only to the requirement that not more than one
election may be held hereunder during any period of twelve consecutive months. All elections
held under the provisions of this amendment shall be called, held, conducted, and canvassed in
such manner as the governing body of Mobile county shall prescribe.

D Not later than February 1 in each tax year for which the special tax may be authorized
hereunder to be levied, the board will certify to the governing body of Mobile county the rate of
the special tax, not exceeding the rate at the time authorized by vote of the qualified electors of
Mobile county as herein provided, that the board has determined should be levied in
order to supply the funds needed for public hospital purposes during the next ensuing fiscal year
of the board. During the month of February in each such tax year the governing body of Mobile
county shall levy the special tax at such rate as may be certified by the board to be necessary, up
to but not exceeding the rate then authorized as aforesaid, and the special tax so levied shall be
due and payable on the then ensuing October 1. If the board should fail to make such certification
with respect to the rate to be levied in any tax year, the governing body of Mobile county shall
levy the special tax for that tax year at the maximum rate then authorized by vote of the qualified
electors of the county as herein provided. All moneys derived from the collection of the special
tax shall be paid over to the board as received and used by the board for public hospital purposes
in the county. The board may anticipate the proceeds from the special tax by issuing for any one
or more public hospital purposes the bonds, warrants, or other securities, of the board and may
pledge for payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon not exceeding 75% of the annual
proceeds from the special tax. All such pledges of the special
tax shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the
special tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.
Bonds and other securities issued by the board, including those that may be issued in anticipation
of the special tax and also any other securities issued by the board, shall not be deemed to
constitute debts of Mobile county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution and shall
not be
construed to be bonds of the county or of any political subdivision thereof within the meaning of
section 222 of the Constitution. 

E The rate of ad valorem taxation for general municipal purposes that is at the time otherwise
permitted by the Constitution to each particular municipal corporation in Mobile county shall be
reduced for the tax year of the municipality next succeeding any tax year of Mobile county for
which the special tax shall have been levied at a rate exceeding one and one-half mills on each
dollar of taxable property in the county, any such reduction to be by a rate of millage equal to the
rate by which the special tax levied for that tax year exceeds one and one-half mills on each
dollar of such taxable property or by one and one-half mills on each dollar of taxable property in
the county, whichever shall be the lesser reduction.

F The rate of ad valorem taxation for general county purposes that is at the time otherwise
permitted to Mobile county by the Constitution shall be reduced, for any tax year for which the
special tax shall be levied, any such reduction to be by the same rate of millage at which the
special tax shall be levied for the same tax year or by one mill on each dollar of taxable
property in the county, whichever shall be the lesser reduction. 

G The rate of that certain ad valorem tax authorized by amendment XVIII [18] to the
Constitution, as amended by the amendment to the Constitution known as amendment XLII [42],
and provided for also in those certain amendments to the Constitution known as amendments LX
[60], C [100], CXXII [122], and CLI [151] and in the constitutional amendment proposed by that
certain act of the 1961 regular session of the legislature of Alabama that was introduced in the
said legislature as House Bill 1067 [amendment No. 193] shall be reduced, for each tax year for
which the special tax shall have been levied at a rate exceeding one mill on each dollar of taxable
property in the county, any such reduction to be by one-half mill on each dollar of taxable
property in the county or by a rate of millage equal to the rate by which the special tax levied for
that tax year exceeds one mill on each dollar of such taxable property, whichever shall be the
lesser reduction.

H Mobile county and each municipal corporation therein are hereby prohibited from making any
appropriation or payment to the board during any tax year of the county in which the special tax
shall be collected, except to provide funds for constructing and equipping public hospital
facilities, unless any such appropriation or payment shall have been authorized by a majority of
the qualified electors of the political subdivision proposing to make such appropriation or
payment at an
election held on the question in the said political subdivision.

If a majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county participating in the election on the
adoption of this amendment shall vote in favor thereof, then the approval of this amendment
expressed by said vote shall of itself authorize the special tax and in that event no additional
election by the voters of Mobile county shall be required to authorize the levy of the special tax.

December 13, 1949, and proclaimed ratified December 21, 1949) within said districts one, two,
and three; provided that the time during which such tax is to continue and the purpose thereof
shall have been first submitted to a vote of the qualified electors in districts one, two, and three of
Franklin county and voted for by a majority of such electors voting at such election. The
governing body of Franklin county may call an election at any time, and it shall be the duty of
such governing body to call an election to be held within ninety days after receipt by it of a
petition signed by not less than 5% of the qualified electors of said districts one, two, and three,
requesting that such election be called. The governing body may call such election to be held at
the same time that this amendment is submitted to the electors of the state for ratification and

date of the last election so held.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by

purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of
said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the
purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said
tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the

so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Franklin county under the authority of this amendment,
which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts
made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this
amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Franklin county or of a political subdivision
thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute

county, as assessed for state taxation for the preceding tax year. The said county shall not,
however, in any event have the power to levy said tax or any part thereof with respect to any tax
year beginning after final payment and retirement of said bonds. The term "taxable property" as
used in this amendment shall include any property that has heretofore been or may hereafter be
exempted from county taxes pursuant to the provisions of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of Title 51 of
the Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended, or other similar statute, and the tax herein provided
for, if authorized, levied and collected, shall be levied on and collected with respect to all such
property just as if it had not been exempted from county taxes. Any provision of section 71 of

of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of
indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and
interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

AMENDMENT 281 RATIFIED

Application of Special School Taxes in City of Anniston.

(A) The purpose of this amendment is to clarify and make further provisions regarding the public
school purposes for which the following special school taxes, heretofore voted in the school
district of the city of Anniston, may be applied: (1) The special annual ad valorem school tax at
the rate of fifty cents (50›) on each one hundred dollars ($100.00) of taxable property which was
voted for public school purposes at the special election held in the said school district on March
16, 1948, pursuant to call of the said election made in that certain amendment to the Constitution
proposed by Act No. 587 adopted at the 1947 regular session of the legislature (sometimes
known as, and herein called, amendment 68), and which was levied by amendment 68 for public
school purposes in the said school district for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax
year beginning October 1, 1947, and with the last year's tax being payable October 1, 1977; and
(2) the special annual ad valorem school tax at the same rate which was voted for public school
purposes at the special election held in the said school district on February 15, 1966, pursuant to
call of the said election made in that certain amendment to the Constitution proposed by Act No.
72 adopted at the 1965 regular session of the legislature (sometimes known as, and herein called,
amendment 232), and which was levied by amendment 232 for public school purposes in the said
school district for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax year beginning October 1,
1977, and with the first year's tax being payable October 1, 1978.

(B) In addition to the public school purposes specifically mentioned in amendment 68, in
amendment 232, and in that certain amendment to the Constitution, supplemental to amendment
68, that was proposed by Act No. 1045 adopted at the 1961 regular session of the legislature
(sometimes known as, and herein called, amendment 165), that portion of the proceeds from the
special school tax levied by amendment 68 in the school district of the city of Anniston that is
not needed to pay debt service on bonds heretofore issued by the city of Anniston under
amendment 68 or under amendment 165, or to comply with any other covenants contained in
proceedings authorizing the issuance of the said bonds, and also the proceeds from the special
school tax levied by amendment 232 may be used to pay the principal of and interest on any
securities
(including, but without limitation to, warrants) that may hereafter be issued by the city of
Anniston, pursuant to request by the city board of education of Anniston, for the purpose of (i)
paying costs of acquiring, constructing and improving public school buildings in the said school
district, (ii) refunding the principal of warrants or other securities issued by the said city,
after the effective date of amendment 232, for payment of costs of acquisition, construction and
improvement of public school buildings, or (iii) the combined purpose of payment of such costs
and such refunding. Costs of constructing a school building shall be deemed to include the costs
of acquiring a site therefor. Any such securities may be either general obligations of the city of
Anniston secured by a pledge of the proceeds of either or both of the said school taxes or may be
special obligations of the said city payable solely out of and secured by a pledge of the proceeds
of either or both of the said taxes; and any such securities shall be issued by the said city pursuant
to the powers conferred on municipalities by existing statutes. Any pledges that may hereafter be
made either hereunder or under amendment 232 with respect to the proceeds from the special
school tax levied by amendment 232, shall take precedence in the order in which they are made.
Any pledges that may hereafter be made either hereunder or under amendment 165, with respect
to the proceeds from the special school tax levied by amendment 68 shall take precedence in the
order in which they are made and shall be subordinate to the pledges heretofore made by the city
of Anniston pursuant to either amendment 68 or amendment 165. If the proceeds of the tax
levied by amendment 232 should at any time be pledged pursuant to either this amendment or
amendment 232, the tax collector of Calhoun county shall, upon collection thereof, pay such
proceeds to the city of Anniston; and until the proceeds of the special tax levied by amendment
232 are so pledged, he shall pay such proceeds to the board of education of the city of Anniston.
If pledges are hereunder made with respect to either or both of the said special school taxes, and
if the governing body of the city of Anniston shall hereafter determine that the proceeds from the
tax or taxes so pledged are in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the said pledges and any
other then outstanding pledges made under any of the other amendments herein referred to, then
the said proceeds, to the extent of the said excess, may be applied for other public school
purposes in the said school district.

(C) The provisions hereof are supplemental to amendments 68, 165, and 232 and the powers and
authority herein granted shall be in addition to the powers and authority conferred by the said
amendments.

(D) Each of the said special elections held as aforesaid on March 16, 1948, and on February 15,
1966, is hereby validated, in spite of any irregularities in connection with the giving of notice or
the holding thereof or any other irregularity in connection therewith.

Bonds for Theodore Ship Channel Project in Mobile Harbor.

The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted for the purpose of financing the work
required of the Alabama state docks as the local sponsoring agency for the improvement in
Mobile harbor, Alabama, known as the Theodore ship channel project or for additional
improvements for the Alabama state docks and in evidence of the indebtedness so incurred to
issue and sell, in addition to all other bonds of the state, interest-bearing general obligation bonds
of the state not exceeding four million dollars ($4,000,000) in principal amount. The full faith
and credit and taxing power of the state are hereby pledged to the prompt and faithful payment of
the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon.

The Alabama state docks department (which term as used herein shall be construed to include
any other agency of the state that may succeed to said department's functions) shall, subject to the
provisions of the bond order relating to the sale of the $10,000,000 principal amount of general
obligation seaport facilities bonds of the state of Alabama dated March 1, 1964, pledge and use
so much of the revenues derived from its seaport facilities as may be necessary to pay at their
maturities the principal of and interest on said bonds, and may pledge, agree to use, and use so
much of said revenues as the said department with the approval of the governor may determine
shall be necessary or desirable to build up and maintain reserves for the payment of said principal
and interest for the maintenance, replacement and improvement of its seaport facilities. The
proceeds from the sale of any such bonds shall, after payment of the reasonable and necessary
expense of their issuance, be set aside in a special fund in the state treasury and shall be paid out
to the Alabama state docks department upon authorization by the governor and shall be held by
the said department in a special trust fund and therefrom disbursed to pay the reasonable and
necessary costs required of the Alabama state docks as the local sponsoring agency for
the improvement in Mobile harbor, Alabama, known as the Theodore ship channel project or to
pay the reasonable and necessary costs of constructing, dredging of approaches thereto and
equipment of works of internal improvement for use and operation as a part of additional state
docks facilities; provided that, if said department shall have issued any notes in anticipation of
the sale of bonds for any of said purposes, then so much as may be necessary, not exceeding
$2,000,000, shall be used to retire or fund said notes.

The Alabama state docks department is hereby vested with full authority, subject to the
provisions of the bond order relating to the sale of $10,000,000 principal amount of general
obligation seaport facilities bonds of the state of Alabama dated March 1, 1964, and except as
limited herein, to prescribe the terms of the bonds and to provide for the issuance and sale
thereof. The bonds may be sold, executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may
be in such forms,
denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or
dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, with rights of
conversion into another form, may be payable in such installments and at such place or places,
may bear interest at such rate or rates, payable and evidenced in such manner, and may contain
provisions for redemption at the option of the state to be exercised by the state docks department
at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or prices,
all as shall be provided by the said department in the order or orders under which the bonds are
issued. The principal of each series of bonds shall mature in annual installments in such amount
as shall be specified in the authorizing order or orders, the first of which installments shall
mature not later than one year after the date of the bonds of such series and the last of which
installments shall mature not later than twenty years after the date of the bonds of the same
series. The largest installment of principal and interest maturing on each series of the bonds in
any one year shall not exceed twice the preceding smallest installment of principal and interest
maturing thereon in any prior year. None of the bonds shall be sold for less than face value plus
accrued interest thereon to the date of delivery. The bonds shall be sold only at public sale or
sales, either on sealed bids or at auction, after such advertisement as may be prescribed by the
said department to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to the state computed
to the respective maturities of the bonds sold; provided, that if no bid deemed acceptable by the
said department is received all bids may be rejected.

The bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the governor and countersigned by the state
docks director, and the great seal of the state of Alabama or a facsimile thereof shall be
impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and shall be attested by the signature of the
secretary of state; provided, that facsimile signatures of any one or any two (but not all) of said
officers may be reproduced on any of such bonds in lieu of being manually signed thereon.
Coupons attached to the bonds and representing installments of interest thereon shall be signed
with the facsimile signature of the state treasurer, which facsimile signature shall constitute due
and sufficient authentication of said coupons.

All bonds issued under the provisions of this amendment, together with the interest income
thereon, shall forever be exempt from taxation in this state. 

The authorization to incur debt and issue bonds contained in this amendment shall supersede and
take the place of any authorization for Alabama state docks department to issue revenue bonds
granted by act of the legislature in effect on the effective date of this amendment.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing and authorization from or other action
by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder.

provided for indebtedness shall not be construed to prohibit or limit appropriations from the
general fund of the state which from time to time may be made for the purpose of enabling the
state to discharge obligations at any time authorized by the legislature to be undertaken in
connection with the waterway project.

The legislature may by appropriate laws establish a public corporation and may confer upon it, in
addition to all other necessary powers, full power to undertake the obligations that the state is
permitted under the foregoing provisions of this amendment to undertake in connection with the
waterway project. The legislature may from time to time appropriate money from the general
fund of the state to be expended by such public corporation and may also authorize the herein
provided for general obligation bonds of the state to be sold from time to time under the
supervision of such public corporation; provided, that all moneys received by such public
corporation from the state, whether as appropriations from the state's general fund or as proceeds
of the sale of the state's bonds, shall be expended, except for reasonable administrative expenses,
in
discharging obligations that the state is permitted under the foregoing provisions of this
amendment to undertake in connection with the waterway project, and shall have directed such
public corporation to undertake in its stead.

Nothing herein shall authorize the legislature to establish any such public corporation to acquire
by purchase, license, lease, condemnation or otherwise a hydroelectric project (or any part
thereof) heretofore or hereafter licensed by the federal power commission under the Federal
Power Act of June 10, 1920, Public Law No. 280, 66th Congress, 2nd Session, and

respective meanings:

"County" means Mobile county.

"Special tax" means the annual ad valorem tax at the rate of «  of 1 per centum (equivalent to 5
mills on each dollar) of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the county authorized to
be levied by the county by the amendment known as amendment XVIII [18] to the Constitution
of Alabama, as amended by the amendment to the Constitution known as amendment CLII [152],
and also provided for in the amendments to the Constitution known as amendments C [100],
CXXII [122], CLI [151], CXCIII [193], and CXCV [195].

Section B. Mobile county is hereby authorized to issue from time to time its bonds, not

county, and $2,000,000 in principal amount shall be issued for the purpose of acquiring,
providing, constructing and equipping additions and improvements to the county courthouse
building in the county; provided, that if all of the proceeds from the bonds issued for either of the
said purposes shall not be needed for the purpose for which they were issued then the balance not
so needed may in the sound judgment of the governing body of the county be expended for the
said other purpose. The aggregate principal amount of all bonds at any time issued under this
amendment,
when added to the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding bonds theretofore issued by
the county under any other amendment to the Constitution of Alabama that are payable from or
secured by the special tax shall not exceed 6 «  per centum of the assessed valuation of the
taxable property situated in the county as assessed for state taxation for the state tax year next
preceding that during which any bonds herein authorized shall be issued.

No bonds may be issued under the authority of this amendment until after the question of the
issuance of such bonds shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of the county at any
election called for that purpose by the governing body of the county and a majority of the said
qualified electors voting at the said election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of
such bonds; provided, that if a majority of the qualified electors of the county participating in the
election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for the adoption thereof, then the approval
of this amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the
issuance of the bonds provided for in this amendment and no additional election by the electors
of the county shall be required to authorize the issuance of the said bonds. If the majority of the
qualified electors of the county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment
should not vote in favor of the adoption of this amendment, or if the majority of the qualified
electors of the county voting at any election called by the governing body of the county under the
provisions of this amendment should not vote in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at
an election so called, the governing body of the county may from time to time call other elections
hereunder on the issuance of such bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held
during any period of twelve consecutive months. Any such election called by the governing body
of the county shall be called, held, conducted and canvassed, and may be contested, in the
manner and within the time provided by the then existing general laws of Alabama pertaining to
elections on the issuance of bonds by counties.

The bonds issued hereunder shall be general obligations of the county for the payment of the
principal of and interest on which the full faith and credit of the county shall be irrevocably
pledged, and in addition thereto there shall be irrevocably pledged for payment of the said
principal and interest so much of the special tax as may be necessary to pay the said principal and
interest at their respective maturities, each such pledge to be on a parity with all valid pledges of
the special tax at any time heretofore or hereafter made, to such extent as shall not impair the
obligation of any then existing valid prior pledges.

The principal of each series of bonds issued under this amendment shall mature in annual
installments, the first of which installments shall mature not later than three (3) years after the
date of the bonds of that series and the last of which shall mature not later than thirty (30) years
after the date of the bonds of that series; provided, that the maturities of each series of bonds
issued under this amendment shall be arranged so that (a) no annual installment of principal of
the bonds of such series maturing during any fiscal year of the county shall be more than four
times as great as the smallest installment of principal of the same series maturing during any
prior fiscal year, and (b) the aggregate amount of principal and interest that will mature in any
one fiscal year with respect to that series of bonds, and also all other bonds theretofore issued by
the county and then outstanding that are payable out of or secured by a pledge of the special tax,
shall not exceed the amount of the proceeds collected from the special tax during the then next
preceding tax year. Except as herein otherwise provided, all bonds issued under this amendment
shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of
Alabama existing at the time of the issuance of such bonds respecting the sale, execution,
issuance and redemption
of bonds by counties. The indebtedness evidenced by the bonds issued under this amendment or
under any other amendment to the Constitution which are payable out of or are secured by a
pledge of the special tax shall be in addition to and shall not be charged against the limitation on
the indebtedness of the county provided for in section 224 of the Constitution.

So long as the principal of or interest on any of the bonds issued under this amendment remains
unpaid, the governing body of Mobile county shall continue the levy of the special tax at such
rate as may be sufficient to pay the said principal and interest at their respective maturities;
provided, that the total rate of the special tax that may be levied and collected for payment of the
said bonds and all other bonds payable out of or secured by a pledge of the special tax shall not
exceed 4
«  mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of all properties subject to taxation by the
county as assessed for state taxation and that the said rate of 4 «  mills on each dollar of the said
assessed valuation shall be reduced for each tax year for which the special hospital tax authorized
in paragraph G of the amendment to the Constitution known as amendment No. CXCV [195]
shall have been levied at a rate exceeding 1 mill on each dollar of the taxable property in the
county, any such reduction to be by «  mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of the taxable
property in the county or by rate of millage equal to the rate by which the said special hospital tax
levied for that tax year exceeds one mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of such taxable
property, whichever shall be the lesser reduction. The provisions of this paragraph shall be
applicable, however, only to such extent as shall not impair the obligation of any pledges of the
special tax heretofore made for the benefit of any bonds issued by the county prior to the
adoption of this amendment.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing, and authorization from or other action
by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder or the levy of the
special tax for payment thereof.

record. "Commission" means judicial commission. "Retire" means to place on supervisory status
if available. "Chairman" includes the acting chairman. "Masters" means special master appointed

designated by the supreme court or in the absence of such designation, the judge first named in
the order appointing masters. "Shall" is mandatory and "may" is permissive.

2 A judicial commission is hereby created which shall be authorized to investigate, conduct
hearings on the qualifications of judges and make recommendations to the supreme court in
regard to the retirement, censure, suspension or removal of such judges. The commission shall
consist of: one judge of the court of appeals to be appointed by the supreme court; two judges
of circuit courts to be appointed by the circuit judges association; one probate judge to be
appointed by the probate judges association; one judge of a municipal court to be appointed by
the supreme court; two practicing attorneys who shall be members in good standing of the state
bar who shall have practiced law in this state for at least ten years and who shall be appointed by
the board of commissioners of the state bar, and two citizens neither of whom shall be a judge,
active or retired, nor a member of the state bar, and who shall be appointed by the governor
subject to the approval of the Alabama senate. The terms of these members shall be for six years.
Of the initial appointees, three (a circuit judge, the judge of the court of appeals and a citizen)
shall be appointed for six years; three members (the municipal court judge, the probate judge and
a practicing attorney) shall be appointed for four years; and three members (a circuit judge, a
practicing attorney and a citizen) shall be appointed for three years. Commission membership
shall terminate if a member ceases to hold the position that qualified him for appointment. A
vacancy shall be filled by the appointing power for the remainder of the term; provided, that if
the appointing power shall not fill the vacancy within sixty days, replacement shall be made by
majority vote of the commission.

No member shall receive any compensation for his services as such but shall be allowed his
necessary expenses for travel, board and lodging incurred in the performance of his duties as
such, which shall be paid from the state treasury on claims filed with the state comptroller.

No act of the commission shall be valid unless concurred in by a majority of its members. The
commission shall select one of its members to serve as chairman.

3 A judge, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section, may be censured,
suspended, or removed for action occurring not more than six years prior to the commencement
to his current term that constitutes willful misconduct in office, willful and persistent failure to
perform his duties, habitual intemperance, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of
justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or he may be retired for disability that
seriously interferes with the performance of his duties and is or is likely to become permanent.
The judicial commission may, after such investigation as the commission deems necessary, order
a hearing to be held before it concerning the censure, suspension, removal or retirement of a
judge, or the commission may in its discretion request the supreme court to appoint three special
masters, who shall be justices or judges of courts of record, to hear and take evidence in any such
matter, and to report thereon to the commission. If, after hearing, or after considering the record
and report of the masters, the commission finds good cause therefor, it shall recommend to the
supreme court the censure, suspension, removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the judge. 

The supreme court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and in its

suspension, removal or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the
recommendation. Upon an order for retirement, the judge shall be considered to have retired
voluntarily and shall thereby be retired with the same rights and privileges as if he retired
pursuant to statute. Upon an order for
removal, the justice or judge shall thereby be removed from office, and his salary shall cease
from the date of such order. A judge removed by the supreme court shall be ineligible for judicial
office and pending further order of the supreme court he shall be suspended from practicing law
in this state.

All papers filed with and proceedings before the judicial commission or masters appointed by the

such filing loses its confidential character and (b) a writing which was privileged prior to its
filing with the commission or the masters does not lose such privilege by such filing. The judicial
conference shall by rule provide for procedure under this section before the judicial commission,
the masters, and the supreme court. A judge who is a member of the commission or supreme
court shall not participate in any proceedings involving his own censure, suspension, removal or
retirement.

A judge shall be disqualified from acting as a judge, without loss of salary, while there is pending
(1) an indictment on an information charging him in the United States with a crime punishable as
a felony under Alabama or federal law or (2) a recommendation to the supreme court by the
judicial commission for his censure, suspension, removal or retirement.

On recommendation of the commission or on its own motion, the supreme court may suspend a
judge from office without salary when in the United States he pleads guilty or no contest or is
found guilty of a crime punishable as a felony under Alabama or federal law or of any other
crime that involves moral turpitude under that law. If his conviction is reversed, suspension
terminates, and he shall be paid his salary for the period of suspension. If he is suspended and his
conviction
becomes final, the supreme court shall remove him from office.

4 This amendment is self-executing. The commission is authorized and directed to make rules
not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment implementing this amendment and
providing for the confidentiality of proceedings.

A In addition to all taxes now or hereafter authorized by the Constitution of Alabama, including
amendment CCLXIX [269], Baldwin county or any incorporated municipality within such county
which supports, jointly supports, or proposes to support a public library is hereby authorized to
levy and collect a special tax of not more than forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars worth
of taxable property within such county or municipality as assessed for state taxation. The
proceeds of all such taxes shall be used exclusively for public library purposes; provided, that the
levy of such tax, the rate of such tax and the purpose thereof shall have been first submitted to
the vote of the qualified electors of the county or municipality and voted for by a majority of
those voting at such election.

B Upon petition signed by four hundred or more qualified electors of Baldwin county to the
Baldwin county commission or like governing body, or upon a petition signed by two hundred or
more qualified electors of any municipality in such county to the governing body of such
municipality, the county commission or the governing body of the municipality shall order an
election to be held to determine whether a special tax shall be levied at the rate specified by the
governing body of such county or municipality for public library purposes.

C Elections under this amendment relative to additional county taxes for county public library
purposes shall be held at the same time any other general or special election is held in which the
voters of the entire county are qualified to vote, and elections under this amendment relative to
municipal taxes for municipal library purposes shall be held at the same time any other municipal
election is held.

D If authorized by the vote of the majority of the qualified electors voting in any such election
called for the purpose, the county or city governing body, as the case may be, shall levy and
collect, in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, a special annual ad valorem tax at the rate
prescribed and approved by the electors voting in the election. If the majority vote at any election
held hereunder is not in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall
be voted at a rate of less than forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars worth of taxable
property, then the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be, may from time to
time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of the special tax or on the increase of
the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding a total amount of forty-five cents on each one hundred
dollars of taxable property, and must call any such election at the next general or special
countywide election or next municipal election, as the case may be, next following the receipt of
a petition in the manner and form herein prescribed. Provided, however, that not more than one
election upon the levy or upon the increase of the rate of the special tax shall be held during any
period of twelve consecutive months. After the special tax shall have been levied for a period of
three years, the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be, upon its own original
action may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the question of the
discontinuance of the tax or a reduction on the rate thereof, upon the payment in full of all
obligations then outstanding, if any, and when a reduced rate will provide sufficient revenue for
the purposes for which the tax was levied. If the majority of electors participating in the election
vote in favor of the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the tax, as the case may be, such
discontinuance or reduction shall become effective for the tax year next succeeding the tax year
in which such election is held. Provided, that not more than one election for the discontinuance
or reduction in the rate of the special tax shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive
months. All such elections shall be called, held and conducted in the same manner as are
elections proposing the special tax.

incur indebtedness in relation to the assessment of property therein for state taxes or for state and
county taxes such provision shall mean as assessed for county or municipal taxes as the case may

term in the same manner as such member was originally chosen.

The probate judge of Madison county shall record all such certificates of election and shall safely
and permanently keep the original certificates. Forthwith upon his receipt and recordation of
every such certificate, he shall send to the governor a certified copy of every such certificate.

No member of such commission shall be eligible to succeed himself as such member or for

Special District School Tax in Calhoun County.

In addition to any taxes now authorized or that may be hereafter authorized by the Constitution
and laws of Alabama, each school district in Calhoun county, except the school district
comprising the city of Anniston, shall have the power to levy and collect for public school
purposes in such district an annual special ad valorem tax on the taxable properties in such
district
at a rate not exceeding in any one year five mills on each dollar of the value of the said properties
as the same shall be assessed for state taxation; provided, that the said special ad valorem district
tax shall not be levied in any such district for any year prior to the year for which the said tax if
levied will become due and payable on October 1, 1978; provided further, that prior to the levy
of any special tax authorized in this paragraph, there shall be submitted to the electors of the
district in which the tax is proposed to be levied, at a special election called for that purpose in
the said district, the question of whether the said tax or any part thereof shall be levied, the rate
thereof, the time it is to continue (which shall not exceed thirty years), and the purpose thereof,
and the said tax shall be authorized at such election by a majority of the qualified electors of the
said district who vote at such election; provided further, that if a majority of the qualified electors
of any of the said districts participating in the election on the ratification of this amendment shall
vote for the ratification of this amendment, then the approval of this amendment as expressed by
the vote in said district in favor of its ratification shall, of itself, authorize the levy and collection
of the said special tax for public school purposes in that district for a period of thirty years
commencing with the levy for the tax year for which taxes will become due and payable to the
said district on October 1, 1978.

Elections on the question of the levy of a district tax under the provisions of this amendment may
be held at any time and from time to time, provided, that if at any such election held after the
ratification of this amendment the proposal to levy the tax so submitted should be defeated then
the proposal may not be submitted at another election held in the same district within six months
from the last election held under this amendment. Each such election held after the ratification of
this amendment shall be called and held, the results declared, and the tax levied and collected in
the same manner as now or hereafter provided by law in the case of school district taxes
authorized by amendment III [3] to the Constitution of Alabama, except that no county-wide tax
shall be required as a condition precedent for a district tax under this amendment.

The funds arising from the district tax herein authorized to be levied shall be expended for the
exclusive benefit of the school district in which such district tax is levied. Nothing in this
amendment shall be deemed to prevent the consolidation of any two or more school districts in
Calhoun county in accordance with the applicable provisions of general law.

Pursuant to the amendment to the Constitution of Alabama sometimes known as amendment
LXVIII [68] (proposed by Act No. 587 adopted at the 1947 Regular Session of the Legislature of
Alabama), there is currently being levied in each school district in Calhoun county a special
district school tax at the same rate as is specified in the first paragraph of this amendment, but the
last tax year for which the special tax provided for in the said amendment LXVIII [68] is
authorized to be levied is the tax year for which taxes will become due and payable on October 1,
1977. It is intended by this amendment to make provision for the authorization of the continued
levy in each school district in Calhoun county, except the school district comprising the city of
Anniston, of a special district ad valorem school tax at the same rate as, but in lieu of, the tax
authorized in the said amendment LXVIII [68], to commence with the tax year next following the
final tax year for which the tax provided for in the said amendment No. LXVIII [68] is
authorized to be levied. It is not intended by this amendment to provide for or authorize an
increase in the total rate of taxation for public school purposes in excess of that currently
authorized to be levied in the several school districts in Calhoun county.

property, enforceable by the sale thereof.

5 Subject to the conditions stated in paragraph 6, below, the county governing body may by
ordinance levy a tax on all taxable property in any district in addition to any other tax authorized

taxes; the interest and penalties payable on such taxes not paid when due; the lien for the taxes;
and the remedies for collection of such taxes unpaid.

paragraph 11, below. The county governing body shall enact ordinances providing for the
administration of the affairs of the district by the county governing body, the governing body of
the district, or by any agency of the county and empowering the body administering the affairs of

governing body to levy the taxes provided for in paragraph 5, above, subject to the restrictions
and conditions imposed by this amendment and such additional restrictions and conditions as the
county governing body, by ordinance, may impose.

10 The county governing body, by ordinance, may provide for the issuance of bonds for such
districts with or without an election; provided, however, that all bonds issued hereunder shall be
payable only out of the proceeds of the service charges and taxes authorized hereby, and no such
bond shall be a general obligation of the county.

11 The legislature may, from time to time, adopt laws governing service districts, including laws
repealing any ordinance of the county governing body inconsistent with any law enacted by the
legislature prior to the adoption of this amendment. If there is any inconsistency between any law
enacted by the legislature after adoption of this amendment and any ordinance adopted by the
county governing body, the law shall prevail over such ordinance. In order for a law enacted
subsequent to the adoption of this amendment to prevail over any ordinance in conflict with such

Fire Protection in Limestone County.

The Limestone county governing body is authorized in its discretion to establish fire districts
within the geographical boundaries of Limestone county, said districts to exclude any corporate
municipality which does not request through resolution of its governing body to be made a part
of and subject to the provisions of this amendment. The county governing body, in its discretion,
may establish, in lieu of or in addition to said fire districts, a county fire department to furnish
county-wide fire protection.

The governing body may name a fire marshal for Limestone county, whose principal duty shall
be the coordination of fire protection within the county including all fire departments and fire
stations, either in the district or county, and their full-time and part-time employees. Upon the
request of the county governing body the fire marshal shall submit a budget for the county fire
department and shall perform such other tasks related to fire protection as may, from time to
time, be assigned to him by the county governing body.

The governing body is hereby authorized to fix a county fire protection tax, which tax shall
become effective upon the approval of a majority of electors within any particular fire district or
other area of the county where the tax is to be levied. The tax fixed by the governing body shall
be based upon the value of real and personal property assessed by affected property owners, as
shown on the records of the tax assessor of Limestone county, Alabama, and shall be assessed
and
collected as are all ad valorem taxes in the county. The amount collected each year from
assessment of this fire protection tax shall be paid into the county general fund and used in
furtherance of fire protection within the affected area.

The county governing body is hereby authorized upon approval by resolution adopted by said
governing body to adopt, amend and repeal regulations for the safeguarding of life and property
from the hazards of fire and explosion in the county, which shall be known as the Limestone
County Fire Protection Code. Such regulations shall have the force and effect of law and any
violation thereof may, within the discretion of the county governing body, constitute a Class A
misdemeanor, as defined in Act No. 607, S. 33 of the 1977 Regular Session (Acts 1977, p. 812),
and upon conviction thereof may be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment
in the county jail, not to exceed one year, or both fine and imprisonment. Said code shall be
effective in all unincorporated areas of the county and in those incorporated areas which choose
to come under the provisions of this act.

The county governing body is hereby authorized to employ or to authorize the employment of a
fire marshal, fire inspectors, firemen, secretarial and clerical employees and any other employees
which it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this act and it is further authorized to
make such expenditures for salaries, equipment, property (whether real, personal or mixed), or
other expenses related to fire protection which it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of
this amendment.

The legislature may provide for or amend, from time to time, any laws pertaining to fire districts

Amendment of Section 217.

SECTION 217

Classification of taxable property for purposes of ad valorem taxation; taxable property to be
taxed by state, counties, municipalities, etc., at same rate; assessment ratios for purposes of ad
valorem taxation; increase or decrease of assessment ratios by counties, municipalities, etc.;
increase or decrease of ad valorem tax rates by counties, municipalities, etc.; maximum amount
of ad valorem tax; certain property to be assessed at current use value and not market value;
exemption of certain property from ad valorem taxation; interpretation of authority for counties,
municipalities, etc., to levy taxes, borrow money, etc., in relation to assessment of property;
counties, municipalities, etc., authorized to levy additional ad valorem tax for costs of certain
state-wide reappraisal of property.

(a) On and after October 1, 1978, all taxable property within this state, not exempt by law, shall
be divided into the following classes for the purposes of ad valorem taxation:

(b) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state, all taxable property shall be forever
taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such property shall be assessed for ad
valorem tax purposes according to the classes thereof as herein defined at the following ratios of
assessed value to the fair and reasonable market value (except as otherwise provided in
subsection (j) hereof) of such property:

(c) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by counties, municipalities or other taxing authorities,
all taxable property shall be forever taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such
property shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes according to the classes of property
defined in subsection (a) hereof and at the same ratios of assessed value to the fair and reasonable
market value thereof as fixed in subsection (b) hereof, except as otherwise provided in subsection
(j) hereof and this subsection (such ratios being herein called "assessment ratios"). In connection
with the ad valorem taxes that a county, municipality or other taxing authority is authorized or
required to levy and collect pursuant to any provision of this Constitution, for the ad valorem tax
year beginning October 1, 1978, any such taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by
act of the legislature, by resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, at any time not
later than September 30, 1979, increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class
of taxable property, such increase or decrease to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning
on and after October 1, 1978. If (1) a county, municipality or other taxing authority adjusts an
assessment ratio pursuant to the preceding sentence and (2) the receipts from all ad valorem
taxes levied by or with respect to such taxing authority during the ad valorem tax year beginning
October 1, 1978, exceed by more than five percent, or are less than 95 percent of, the receipts
from such ad valorem taxes for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any
time not later than September 30, 1980, for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October
1, 1979, the taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, by
resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, adjust any assessment ratio applicable
to any class of taxable property. On and after October 1, 1979, the governing body of any county,
municipality or other taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature,
at any time increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property;
provided, that any proposed adjustment to an assessment ratio to be made pursuant to this
sentence, whether an increase or a decrease, shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body
of the taxing authority after a public hearing on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act
of the legislature, and (3) subsequently approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors
residing in the taxing authority who vote on the proposal at a special election called and held in
accordance with the law governing special elections. No decrease in an assessment ratio pursuant
to this subsection (c) shall be permitted with respect to either of the ad valorem tax years
beginning October 1, 1978, and October 1, 1979, if such county, municipality or other taxing
authority has increased any millage rate under subsection (e) of this section with respect
to such ad valorem tax year. The legislature shall enact general laws applicable to all counties,
municipalities and other taxing authorities regulating and establishing criteria for the exercise of
the powers granted such taxing authorities to adjust assessment ratios as hereinabove provided.
Such assessment ratios as herein authorized may vary among taxing authorities so long as each
such assessment ratio is uniform within a taxing authority. Any decrease in any assessment ratio
pursuant to this subsection shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured
by any tax levied by the taxing authority decreasing the assessment ratio. Any action authorized
by this subsection to be taken by a taxing authority, or the governing body thereof, shall, other
than in the case of a municipality, be taken by resolution of the governing body of the county in
which such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority.

(d) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state or by any county, municipality or other
taxing authority, no class of taxable property shall have an assessment ratio of less than five per
centum nor more than 35 per centum.

(e) A county, municipality or other taxing authority may decrease any ad valorem tax rate at any
time, provided such decrease shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness
secured by such tax. For the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, when the tax
assessor of each county shall complete the assembly of the assessment book for his county for
that ad valorem tax year and the computation of ad valorem taxes that will be paid upon such
assessment, he shall certify to each authority within his county that levies an ad valorem tax the
amount of ad valorem tax that will be produced by every levy in that ad valorem tax year but
excluding for this purpose any assessment of new taxable property not previously subject to
taxation (except "escaped" property as defined by law) added to the tax rolls of such county for
the ad valorem tax year in which such certification is made that was not included on the tax rolls
for the next preceding ad valorem tax year. Any county, municipality or other taxing authority, at
any time not later than September 30, 1979, may increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is
levied by or with respect to that taxing authority above the limit otherwise provided in this
Constitution, provided that the amount of the above-described certification of anticipated tax
receipts with respect to such tax is less than 120 percent of the actual receipts from such tax for
the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, such increase to be effective for ad valorem
tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978; provided, that any such millage increase shall
not exceed in mills the total of (i) the number of additional mills that is necessary, when added to
the millage rate imposed with respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in
the taxing authority for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, to produce revenue
that is not less than and that is substantially equal to that received by the taxing authority with
respect to such tax during such immediately preceding ad valorem tax year, plus (ii) a number of
additional mills equal to 20 percent of the total mills imposed by that taxing authority with
respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority for the ad
valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977. If, for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1,
1978, the receipts from any ad valorem tax with respect to which any millage rate has been
increased pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are less than 95 percent of the receipts
from such ad valorem tax for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any
time not later than September 30, 1980, the taxing authority may increase any millage rate with
respect to such ad valorem tax in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
such increase to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1979. It
is further provided that all millage adjustments shall be made in increments of not less than one
tenth ( 1/10 ) mill.

(f) On and after October 1, 1979, any county, municipality or other taxing authority may at any
time increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is levied above the limit otherwise provided in
this Constitution; provided, that the proposed increase to be made pursuant to this subsection
shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body of the taxing authority after a public hearing
on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act of the legislature, and (3) subsequently
approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the taxing authority who vote on
the proposal at a special election called and held in accordance with the law governing special
elections. Any adjustments or other actions authorized to be made or taken pursuant to this
subsection and subsection (e) hereof shall be made or taken by resolution of the governing
body of such taxing authority, or if there is no such governing body and in the case of a taxing
authority other than a municipality, by resolution of the governing body of the county in which
such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority. The provisions of
subsections (c), (e) and (f) of this section shall not apply to ad valorem taxes levied
by the state.

(g) The legislature is authorized to enact legislation to implement the provisions of this section
and may provide for exemptions from taxation; provided, that unless otherwise expressly
provided, no amendment to this section shall be construed to repeal any statutory exemption
existing on the effective date of any such amendment hereto.

(h) Wherever any constitutional provision or statute provides for, limits or measures the power or
authority of any county, municipality or other taxing authority to levy taxes, borrow money or
incur indebtedness in relation to the assessment of property therein for state taxes or for state and
county taxes, such provision shall mean as assessed for county or municipal
taxes, as the case may be.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, including any amendment thereto whenever
adopted with respect to taxable property located in the city of Mountain Brook, the city of
Vestavia Hills, or the city of Huntsville, the amount of ad valorem taxes payable to the state and
to all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities with respect to any item of taxable
property described as Class I property shall never exceed 2 percent of the fair and reasonable
market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect
to any item of Class II property shall never exceed 1 1/2 percent of the fair and reasonable market
value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect to any
item of Class IV property shall never exceed 1 1/4 percent of the fair and reasonable market
value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, and such amount with respect to
any item of Class III property shall never exceed 1 percent of the fair and reasonable market
value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year. Whenever the total amount of ad
valorem property taxes otherwise payable by any taxpayer with respect to any item of taxable
property shall exceed in any one ad valorem tax year the maximum amount of such taxes
permitted by this section, such amount of taxes shall be reduced by subtracting that amount of tax
due that is in excess of the amount of tax otherwise permissible under the Constitution. In
connection with the taxation of any item of taxable property, the amount of tax to be subtracted
with respect to each authority levying and collecting any ad valorem property tax shall be in the
same proportion to the total amount of tax to be subtracted that the total number of mills on each
dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied by such taxing authority bears to
the total number of mills on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied
by all taxing authorities with respect to such item of taxable property. Before sending to any
taxpayer any notice relating to the collection of ad valorem taxes, the tax collector in each county
shall determine whether any portion of the amount of ad valorem property tax otherwise due with
respect to any item of taxable property shall be subtracted pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection and shall apportion the amount to be subtracted in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on and after October 1, 1978, taxable
property defined in subsection (a) hereof as Class III property shall, upon application by the
owner of such property, be assessed at the ratio of assessed value to the current use value of such
taxable property and not the fair and reasonable market value of such property. The legislature
may enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all counties, municipalities and other taxing
authorities establishing criteria and procedures for the determination of the current use value of
any eligible taxable property and procedures for qualifying such property for assessment at its
current use value. The legislature may also enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all
counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities providing for the ad valorem taxation of any
taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation; provided, however, that any
additional tax on taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation shall not apply to
more than the three ad valorem tax years immediately preceding such cessation of qualification
(including as one such year the year in which cessation of qualification occurs).

(k) The following property shall be exempt from all ad valorem taxation: the real and personal
property of the state, counties and municipalities and property devoted exclusively to religious,
educational or charitable purposes, household and kitchen furniture, all farm tractors, all farming
implements when used exclusively in connection with agricultural property and all stocks of
goods, wares and merchandise.

(l) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, with respect to the costs of reappraisal
incident to the state-wide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, each
county, municipality or other taxing authority for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after
October 1, 1978, may impose and levy an additional ad valorem tax of not more than two mills
on all taxable property located in the taxing authority in order to reimburse itself for its payment
of such costs of reappraisal or to pay any unpaid costs or its pro rata share of such unpaid costs of
reappraisal. The taxes provided for in this subsection, or any pro rata part thereof, shall terminate
at the end of the ad valorem tax year in which sufficient funds are received from the taxes to pay
in full the said reappraisal costs and any receipts from such taxes that are received during the ad
valorem tax year of their termination that are not needed for the purposes specified herein may be
used by the taxing authority levying the tax for general purposes of the taxing authority. The
taxes authorized in this subsection shall not exceed in the aggregate, with respect to any item of
taxable property located in the taxing authority, a total of two mills for all such taxes levied by all
taxing authorities in a county and not two mills for each taxing authority in a county. If more than
one such taxing authority in a county has paid or owes all or a portion of its reappraisal costs,
such two mills shall be prorated among such taxing authorities in the county as they may agree,
or if they cannot agree, in the percentage which each such taxing authority's costs of reappraisal
bear to the total costs of reappraisal of all taxing authorities in the county. The provisions of
this subsection shall apply only to the costs incurred by a taxing authority incident to the
state-wide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, the amount of which
costs shall be certified by the department of revenue, and shall not be applicable to any future
reappraisals that may be required by law.

(m) If any portion of this section should be declared invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining portions of this
section, which shall continue effective.

A general law is a law which in its terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or
more municipalities of the state less than the whole in a class. A general law applicable to such a
class of municipalities shall define the class on the basis of criteria reasonably related to the
purpose of the law, provided that the legislature may also enact and change from time to time a
general schedule of not more than eight classes of municipalities based on population according
to any designated federal decennial census, and general laws for any purpose may thereafter be
enacted for any such class. Any law heretofore enacted which complies with the provisions of
this section shall be considered a general law.

No general law which at the time of its enactment applies to only one municipality of the state
shall be enacted after January 1, 1979, unless notice of the intention to apply therefor shall have
been given and shown as provided in section 106 of this Constitution for special, private or local
laws; provided, that such notice shall not be deemed to constitute such law a local law.

A special or private law is one which applies to an individual, association or corporation. A local
law is a law which is not a general law or a special or private law.

Consolidation and Abolition of Certain Offices and Establishment of Consolidated and Unified
Tax System in Coffee County.

The legislature may from time to time, by general or local law, provide for the establishment of a
consolidated and unified system for the assessment and collection of taxes in Coffee county and
for the consolidation of the offices of tax assessor and tax collector of such county into one office
and for the abolition of the offices of tax assessor and tax collector of such county.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Constitution to the contrary, the legislature may, by local
law, provide for the election in 1978 to fill the office of tax assessor or tax collector, of Coffee
county, or such other office created pursuant to this amendment. This authorization specifically
includes, but it is not limited to, the power to suspend the general law relating to
deadlines for filing qualifying documents and payment of fees, to set the terms of the offices
named herein, and to prescribe the method of placing the names of the candidates on the ballot at
the election.

Unless otherwise provided herein, or by local law, the offices of tax assessor and tax collector of
Coffee county shall be filled at the general election in 1978 for terms of two years, beginning
October 1, 1979, and until a revenue commissioner of Coffee county is elected and qualified; and
such revenue commissioner shall be elected at the general election of 1980 for an initial term of
four years, beginning October 1, 1981, and until a successor is elected and qualified. Thereafter,
unless otherwise provided by general or local law, the term of office of revenue commissioner of
Coffee county shall be six years and until a successor is elected and qualified.

Unless otherwise provided by the legislature, the revenue commissioner of Coffee county shall
be charged with the performance of any duty provided by law for the tax assessor and tax
collector of Coffee county, and his compensation shall be fixed by the governing body of the
county. Immediately upon the beginning of the first term of the office of revenue commissioner
of Coffee county, the offices of tax assessor and tax collector shall be abolished. If either of the
offices of tax assessor or tax collector of Coffee county should become vacant at any time from
the effective date of this amendment until October 1, 1981, the remaining officer shall thereupon
become the revenue commissioner of Coffee county and shall serve as such for the balance of the
term for which he was elected, and the offices of tax assessor and tax collector of Coffee county
shall be abolished. Should this event occur 30 days or more before the general election of 1978,
then the office of revenue commissioner of Coffee county shall be filled at such election for a
term of six years, and until a successor is elected and qualified and any person who has qualified
to have his name placed upon the ballot as a candidate for either tax assessor or tax collector of
Coffee county shall be entitled to have his name placed upon the ballot as a candidate for revenue
commissioner of Coffee county.

This article of amendment shall not become operative unless the same is approved by a majority

Section 1. Creation of Trust Fund. For the continuing benefit of the state of Alabama and the
citizens thereof, there is hereby created an irrevocable, permanent trust fund named "The
Alabama Heritage Trust Fund" which shall be funded and administered in accordance with the
provisions of this amendment.

Section 2. Definitions. As used in this amendment, the following words and phrases shall have
the following respective meanings:

Section 3. Management of Trust Fund Vested in Board of Trustees. (a) The trust fund shall be
under the management and control of the board, and all powers necessary or appropriate for the
management and control of the trust fund shall be vested solely in the board. The board shall
have a membership of nine trustees consisting of the governor, the state treasurer, the director of
finance (or such other official as may by law succeed to the responsibilities of the director of
finance), two trustees appointed by the governor, two trustees appointed by the lieutenant
governor, and two trustees appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives. The
governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall each serve as a trustee ex officio,
and the service of each such official as a trustee shall begin and end concurrently with the
beginning and end of his or her tenure in such office. As promptly as practicable after the
effective date of this amendment, the other trustees shall be appointed for the following initial
terms: The trustees to be appointed by the governor shall be appointed for terms beginning
immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1 in the first and
second calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment
shall become effective; the trustees to be appointed by the lieutenant governor shall be appointed
for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on October 1
in the third calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become
effective; and the trustees to be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives shall be
appointed for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on
October 1 in the fourth calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment
shall become effective. Thereafter, the term of office of each appointed trustee shall be six years,
commencing at noon on the October 1 on which the term of the immediate predecessor trustee
shall end.

(b) If at any time there shall be a vacancy among the appointed trustees, a successor trustee shall
be appointed to serve for the unexpired term applicable to such vacancy. The appointment of
each appointed trustee (other than those initially appointed), whether for a full six-year term or to
complete an unexpired term, shall be made by the same officer of the state who appointed the
trustee whose term shall have expired or is to expire or in whose position on the board a vacancy
otherwise exists and shall be made not earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which
such trustee is to take office as such. Each appointed trustee shall hold office from the effective
date of his or her appointment until his or her confirmation or rejection by the senate as provided
in subsection (c) of this section, and, if confirmed by the senate, until the expiration of the
term (or portion thereof) for which he or she was appointed; provided that if the term of any
trustee shall expire prior to the reappointment of such trustee or prior to the appointment of his or
her successor, such trustee shall continue to serve until his or her successor is appointed, and if
such trustee is reappointed for a new term after the expiration of the immediately preceding term
which he or she has been serving, his or her new term of office shall be deemed to have
commenced at noon on the October 1 on which the immediately preceding term shall have
expired. Trustees shall be eligible for reappointment without limit as to the number of terms
previously served.

(c) At the beginning of every regular session of the legislature the governor shall certify to the
senate the names of all who shall have been appointed as trustees since the commencement of the
last regular session of the legislature, and the senate shall confirm or reject each of them as it
shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. If the senate takes no action during such
regular session with respect to any trustee whose appointment was so certified, such trustee shall
be deemed to have been confirmed by the senate. If the senate rejects the appointment of any
trustee, such rejection shall immediately terminate the service of such trustee and the resulting
vacancy in the membership of the board shall be filled by a subsequent appointment made in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. Trustees appointed during a
regular session of the legislature shall not be subject to confirmation or rejection by the senate
until the regular session of the legislature next succeeding their appointment.

(d) Each appointed trustee shall, at the time of his or her appointment and at all times during his
or her term of office, be a qualified elector of the state, and a failure by any trustee to remain so
qualified during such term shall cause a vacancy of the office of such trustee. Each appointed
trustee shall have recognized competence and experience in the evaluation and management of
investments. No person holding a full-time office or position of employment with the United
States of America, the state, any county or municipality in the state, or any instrumentality,
agency or subdivision of any of the foregoing, shall be eligible for appointment as a trustee. Any
person who is an appointed trustee shall be deemed to vacate his or her office as such trustee by
the acceptance of any office or employment which, had such person held such office or
been so employed at the time of his or her appointment as a trustee, would have rendered such
person ineligible for appointment as a trustee. Service by any person as a member, director,
trustee or other participant in the management or administration of any governmental agency,
board or commission, or public educational institution, or other public body of the United States
of America, the state, or any county or municipality or other political subdivision shall not render
such person ineligible for appointment as a trustee unless such service constitutes full-time
employment. Any appointed trustee may be impeached and removed from office as a trustee in
the same manner and on the same grounds provided in Section 174 of the Constitution of
Alabama of 1901, or successor provision thereof, and the general laws of the state for
impeachment and removal of the officers of the state subject to said Section 174 or successor
provision thereof. The
governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance may not be impeached and removed from
office as a trustee apart from their impeachment and removal from the respective offices by
virtue of which, ex officio, they serve as trustees.

(e) The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall perform the duties of
trustees, ex officio, without any compensation other than that to which they are respectively
entitled as governor, state treasurer and director of finance. Appointed trustees shall be entitled to
such compensation for their services as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted
by the legislature, but the power to provide compensation of appointed trustees shall be
discretionary with the legislature and nothing in this amendment shall be construed to confer
upon such trustees an absolute right to any compensation for their services. Each appointed
trustee shall be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of his or her duties
as a trustee.

(f) A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the
board, and decisions shall be made on the basis of a majority of the quorum then present and
voting, with each trustee to have a single vote. No vacancy in the membership of the board or the
voluntary disqualification or abstention of any trustee shall impair the right of a quorum to
exercise all of the powers and duties of the board. The governor shall be the chairman and
presiding officer of the board, and the board may appoint such other officers to perform such
duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment or applicable law, as the board
shall deem necessary or appropriate. In addition to such regular meetings of the board as may be
provided by law or by bylaws or rules duly adopted by the board, special meetings of the board
may be called by the governor acting alone or by any three other trustees acting in concert, in
each case upon two days' notice to each trustee given in person or by registered letter or telegram;
provided, however, that such notice to each trustee may be waived by such trustee, either before
or after the meeting with respect to which such notice would otherwise be required. Any meeting
held by the board for any purpose shall be open to the public, except that executive or secret
sessions may be held by the board when the character or good name of a person is involved. All
proceedings of the board shall be reduced to writing on behalf of the board and maintained in the
permanent records of the board, a copy of which shall be filed in the principal office of the board
and shall be open for public inspection there during regular business hours. The principal office
of the board shall be the principal office of the director of finance.

(g) No trustee shall vote on or participate in the discussion or consideration of any matter coming
before the board in which such trustee, personally or through family connections or business
associations, has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including, but without limitation
thereto, decisions of the board concerning the investment of moneys constituting part of the trust
fund in any deposit or obligation of any bank or corporation in which such trustee may have such
an interest. If there shall be brought before the board any matter in which a trustee shall have any
interest which may conflict with his duties as a trustee, he or she shall immediately make a
complete disclosure to the board of such interest and shall thereafter withdraw from participation
in any deliberation and decision of the board with respect to such matter.

(h) The board shall have all of the powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes and
provisions of this amendment, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
following powers:

provided, however, that any obligation created or assumed by the board shall not create any
pecuniary obligation or liability of the state or the trust fund other than such as shall be payable
out of moneys appropriated by the legislature to defray the expenses of the board in carrying out
the purposes of this amendment. No lien or charge against any assets of the trust fund for any
purpose whatsoever shall be created by or result from any law enacted by the legislature or any
action taken by the board or any other department, agency or instrumentality of the state.

(i) The expenses of making and disposing of investments such as brokerage commissions, legal
expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and other customary transactional
expenses shall, as provided in Section 5(c) of this amendment, be payable from the investment
income of the trust fund, but no administrative or other expenses not specifically required to
make or dispose of a particular investment shall be payable out of any assets of the trust fund.
The legislature shall provide for the administrative and other necessary expenses of the board in
the same manner as it provides for the expenses of operating other departments and agencies of
the state.

Section 4. Sources of Trust Capital. (a) There shall be transferred from the general fund of the
state into the trust fund, as the initial trust capital, moneys in an amount equal to the sum of (i) all
proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments received by the state at any time after January 1,
1981, and on or before November 1, 1981, and (ii) all income or profit derived from the
investment and reinvestment of the proceeds of such oil and gas capital payments (including
income or profit derived from the investment and reinvestment of previously derived income or
profit) prior to the transfer of such proceeds into the trust fund, less and except the following:

Promptly following the effective date of this amendment, the state treasurer shall take all actions
necessary to transfer to the board the possession, control and management of the initial trust
capital. If at the time of such transfer into the trust fund all or part of the initial trust capital is
invested in certificates of deposit or other investments which cannot be converted into cash prior
to the maturity thereof without loss of interest or other penalty, the state treasurer shall directly
transfer such certificates of deposit or other investments to the board as part of the initial trust
capital without first converting the same into cash. In the event that any certificates of deposit or
other investments shall be transferred into the trust fund, the initial trust capital shall include only
the income or profit from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received
by the state on or before such transfer or that constitutes accrued interest, amortized discount or
other amounts which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, should be
considered as having been earned by the state as of the date of such transfer. To the extent that
any income or profit derived from such certificates of deposit or other investments is referable to
any period after the transfer thereof into the trust fund, such income or profit shall constitute trust
income and shall not constitute part of the trust capital (except to the extent otherwise provided
by Section 5(a) of this amendment). Any provision of this amendment to the contrary
notwithstanding, no oil and gas capital payment received by the state after November 1, 1981, or
any income from the investment thereof, shall, unless subsequently authorized by law, be
transferred into the trust fund.

(b) The trust capital shall be augmented by any trust income which, as provided in Section 5(a) of
this amendment, shall have remained in the trust fund beyond the end of the fiscal year next
succeeding the fiscal year during which it was received without having been appropriated for any
purpose by act of the legislature. The trust capital shall also consist of (i) such other moneys or
assets as the legislature may by law appropriate and transfer to the trust fund as a permanent part
thereof and (ii) such other moneys or assets as may be contributed to the trust fund from any
source.

Section 5. Investment of Moneys in Trust Fund; Appropriation of Trust Income. (a) Except to the
extent otherwise provided in Section 6 of this amendment, the trust capital shall be held in
perpetual trust and shall not be appropriated by the legislature or expended or disbursed for any
purpose other than to acquire eligible investments in accordance with the provisions of this
amendment. All eligible investments acquired, in whole or in part, with moneys constituting part
of the trust capital shall to the extent of such moneys constitute part of the trust capital, but any
trust income derived therefrom shall be subject to appropriation and withdrawal by the legislature
to the extent provided in this amendment. Until and including the last day of the fiscal year next
succeeding the fiscal year during which any trust income shall be received into the trust fund,
the legislature may at any time and from time to time, whether before or after the actual receipt of
such trust income, enact laws appropriating all or any part of such trust income for any lawful
purpose, and any trust income so appropriated may be withdrawn from the trust fund at any time
after the receipt thereof; provided, however, that the right of the legislature to appropriate any
trust income prior to the actual receipt thereof shall not be construed to authorize the recognition
and withdrawal of any moneys equivalent to such trust income prior to the actual receipt thereof
into the trust fund. If any trust income shall not be appropriated by a law which becomes
effective on or before the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that during which it was
received, such trust income shall thereafter cease to be subject to appropriation and shall become
part of the trust capital to be held in the trust fund on the same terms and conditions as are
applicable to all
other assets constituting the trust capital. Any trust income appropriated by a law becoming
effective on or before the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that during which it was
received shall remain trust income even though it is permitted to remain in the trust fund after the
end of such fiscal year, and any such trust income shall be subject to withdrawal from the
trust fund at any time thereafter in the manner provided by law for the purposes for which it shall
theretofore have been appropriated.

(b) To the extent practicable, the board shall keep all moneys at any time held in the trust fund
(including both trust capital and trust income) invested in such eligible investments as shall, in its
sole and uncontrolled judgment, produce the greatest trust income over the term of such
investments while preserving the trust capital. In making any investment of moneys held in
the trust fund, the board shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances prevailing
at the time of such investment, which an institutional investor of the highest standard of
prudence, intelligence and financial expertise would exercise in the management and investment
of large assets entrusted to it not for the purpose of speculative profit but for the permanent
generation and disposition of funds, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the
expected amount
and frequency of income. The board shall have full power and authority to select the eligible
investments in which moneys held in the trust fund shall at any time be invested, and, to the
extent not inconsistent with any express provision of this amendment, the eligible investments so
selected shall be acquired from such issuers, underwriters, brokers or other sellers on such terms
and conditions, shall be acquired for purchase prices reflecting such discount below or premium
above the par or face amount thereof, shall bear such dates and be in such form, denominations
and series, shall mature or be subject to mandatory redemption on such dates, shall bear interest
at such rate or rates payable at such intervals or, alternatively, shall provide income to the holder
thereof in such other manner (including, without limitation thereto, the purchase of such
investments at a discount which represents all or part of the income or profit to be derived
therefrom), shall be unsecured or secured in such manner, shall contain such provisions for
prepayment or redemption at the option of the issuer or obligor, and shall contain or be subject to
such other provisions as shall, in all of the foregoing respects, be determined by the board
in the exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment. The board shall have full power and
authority to invest the trust capital in long-term investments producing trust income in
accordance with such schedule as the board shall, in the exercise of its sole and uncontrolled
judgment, determine to be in the best interests of the state, and in determining such schedule the
board
may emphasize future benefits in preference to near-term needs. The board shall have complete
and uncontrolled discretion in making decisions as to when moneys in the trust fund shall be
invested, as to the purchase price or other acquisition cost to be paid or incurred in acquiring
investments for the trust fund, as to when investments constituting part of the trust fund
shall be sold, liquidated or otherwise disposed of, and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
100 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as to the amount and nature of the price or other
consideration to be received by the trust fund upon the sale, liquidation or other disposition of
investments constituting part of the trust fund; provided, however, that to the extent the
provisions of this amendment authorize the withdrawal of moneys from the trust fund (including
both trust capital and trust income) pursuant to appropriation by the legislature, the board shall
invest the moneys so subject to withdrawal in investments which shall mature or otherwise be
subject to liquidation on such terms as will provide cash when required for withdrawal from the
trust fund. No law shall be enacted nor any action taken by the executive department of the state
which impairs or interferes with the power, authority and discretion conferred upon the board by
this amendment with respect to the acquisition, management, control and disposition of
investments at any time constituting part of the trust fund.

(c) The trust income for any period shall be the net income (determined as hereinafter provided)
actually received in cash or cash equivalents during such period from the investment and
reinvestment of all moneys held in the trust fund (including both moneys representing trust
capital and moneys representing previously received trust income that has not become part of the
trust capital). No accrual or other accounting calculation or classification shall constitute the
basis for recognizing trust income unless the moneys in question shall have been actually
received and paid into the trust fund. The trust income for any period shall consist of the
aggregate interest received from investments during such period plus any profit realized during
such period from any payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments resulting in
the receipt of an amount
greater than the purchase price thereof, less (i) any negative audit adjustments to income and any
losses with respect to investments which are required to be charged against the income of the
trust fund for such period pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, (ii) any
accrued interest paid as part of the purchase price of investments acquired during such period,
and (iii) all expenses of selling and disposing of investments during such period such as
brokerage commissions, legal expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and
other customary transactional expenses. For purposes of determining the amount of the trust
capital at any time held in the trust fund, any investment acquired for a purchase price reflecting
a discount below its face or par amount shall, at all times prior to its payment, sale, liquidation or
other disposition, be valued at its original purchase price. If any investment is acquired for a
purchase price reflecting a premium above its face or par amount, then, for purposes of
calculating trust income, the cumulative interest or other income theretofore received from such
investment as of any time shall be reduced by the then applicable amortized premium of such
investment. For
purposes of determining the amount of trust capital at any time held in the trust fund, any
investment acquired for a purchase price reflecting a premium above its face or par amount shall,
at all times prior to its payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition, be valued at its original
purchase price less its then applicable amortized premium.

(d) The trust income shall be adjusted in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this
subsection if the application of generally accepted accounting principles in connection with the
annual audit of the trust fund requires any negative adjustment of income, including the
recognition of any reduction in value or write off of investments for reasons relating to
the probability of their payment or collectibility, or if any loss is realized upon any payment, sale,
liquidation or other disposition of any investment resulting in the receipt of any amount less than
the value thereof determined in accordance with the provisions of this amendment; provided,
however, that no reduction in value of any investment shall be made because the rate of interest
or other yield thereon has fallen below the market rates then applicable to comparable
investments. Any audit adjustment resulting in a charge against income or any loss realized from
the payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments, as the case may be, shall be
charged first against any trust income which, as of the time such adjustment is made or such loss
is realized, has accumulated in the trust fund and is then available for withdrawal, whether or not
theretofore appropriated, and if the amount to be so charged is greater than the amount of
accumulated trust income subject to withdrawal, such amount shall be charged against trust
income thereafter received in the current and succeeding fiscal years until the full amount of such
audit adjustment or loss, as the case may be, has been recovered or made good out of the
investment income of the trust fund, and from and after the time that such audit adjustment is
made or such loss is realized, as the case may be, no income of the trust fund shall be considered
trust income for purposes of this amendment until the full amount of such adjustment or loss
shall have been so recovered or made good. In the event that, as a result of any audit adjustment
or any realized loss, the aggregate amount of income appropriated and withdrawn from the trust
fund as of any time during or at the end of any fiscal year exceeds the aggregate trust income
which, taking into account such adjustment or loss, should have been available for withdrawal at
or before such time, then, and in such event, the excess amount so withdrawn need not be
returned to the trust fund from the general fund of the state or from any other source of funds
available to the state, but the amount of such excess withdrawal shall be recovered through
charges against future income of the trust fund as above provided.

(e) To the extent appropriate and not at the time prohibited by law, the board shall use the
facilities of the state treasurer in the administration of the trust fund, including, but without
limitation thereto, the keeping of records, the management of bank accounts, the transfer of funds
and the safekeeping of securities evidencing investments.

(f) The board shall cause an annual audit of the trust fund to be performed for each fiscal year by
the state auditor or, in the discretion of the board, by an independent accounting firm and shall
cause a report of such audit to be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting principles
and made public within ninety (90) days following the end of the fiscal year covered thereby. The
board shall cause to be prepared and publicized such financial and other information concerning
the trust fund as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but in
the absence of any law directing the preparation and publication of different reports, the board
shall cause to be prepared and made public, within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarterly
period in each fiscal year, a report containing (i) a statement of the trust capital then held in the
trust fund showing any changes thereto since the last quarterly report, (ii) a statement of the trust
income then held in the trust fund showing receipts and withdrawals therefrom during the
quarterly period in question and further showing the portion thereof previously appropriated and
the portion thereof subject to appropriation but not then appropriated, (iii) a statement of the
investments then held in the trust fund including descriptions thereof and the respective values
thereof, (iv) a statement of the trust income received to date during the current fiscal year, (v) if
such report covers the first, second or third quarterly period, an estimate of the trust income
anticipated for the entire current fiscal year and for each of the remaining quarterly periods
thereof, and (vi) an estimate of the trust income anticipated for the next succeeding fiscal year
and in each of the quarterly periods thereof.

Section 6. Alternative Disposition of Certain Trust Fund Moneys. (a) By any duly enacted law or
laws, whether becoming effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, the
legislature may appropriate moneys constituting trust capital or trust income or a combination of
both for the use or benefit of the Alabama Housing Finance Authority in such aggregate amount
as, when added to any amount excluded from the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (3) of the
first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment, shall not exceed the sum of $19,500,000. All or
any part of the moneys so appropriated may be held in the trust fund until disbursed for the
purpose for which appropriated, or all or any part of such moneys may be immediately
withdrawn from the trust fund and transferred to the Alabama Housing Finance Authority for the
use thereof or, alternatively, transferred to the state and held by it until used to pay expenses for
and on behalf of such authority, all in accordance with such law or laws as may from time to time
be enacted by the legislature.

(b) In order to provide an alternative source for the moneys appropriated for the use of the board
of corrections pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-764 enacted at the 1981 Regular Session
of the legislature, the legislature may, by any duly enacted law or laws, whether becoming
effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, appropriate moneys constituting
trust capital or trust income or a combination of both for the use of the board of corrections in
making capital expenditures; provided, however, that the aggregate amount so appropriated for
the use of the board of corrections and withdrawn from the trust fund shall not exceed an amount
computed as the difference between $45,000,000 and the sum of (i) the amount excluded from
the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (1) of the first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment
and (ii) all other amounts at any time appropriated by the legislature from the proceeds of bonds
of the state or other sources for the use of the board of corrections in substitution for or
replacement of all or any part of the moneys appropriated pursuant to said Act No. 81-764.

(c) In order to provide an alternative source for the moneys appropriated for the use of the
department of mental health pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-770 enacted at the 1981
Regular Session of the legislature, the legislature may, by any duly enacted law or laws, whether
or not becoming effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, appropriate
moneys constituting trust capital or trust income or a combination of both for the use of the
department of mental health in making capital expenditures; provided, however, that the
aggregate amount so appropriated for the use of the department of mental health and withdrawn
from the trust fund shall not exceed an amount computed as the difference between $65,000,000
and the sum of (i) the amount excluded from the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (2) of
the first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment and (ii) all other amounts at any time
appropriated by the legislature from the proceeds of bonds of the state or other sources for the
use of the department of mental health in substitution for or replacement of all or any part of the
moneys appropriated pursuant to said Act No. 81-770.

Section 7. Limitation of Personal Liability of Trustees. An individual trustee shall not in any way
be personally liable for any liability, loss or expense suffered by the trust fund unless such
liability, loss or expense arises out of or results from the willful misconduct or wrongdoing of
such trustee.

Section 8. Legislative Oversight Commission. (a) There is hereby created the Alabama Heritage
Trust Fund Legislative Oversight Commission to consist of the lieutenant governor, the speaker
of the house, and five members each from the house of representatives and the senate to be
appointed by the speaker of the house and the lieutenant governor, respectively. If the legislature
is in regular session at the time this amendment shall become effective, the original members of
the commission shall be appointed at such regular session, and if the legislature is not in regular
session at the time this amendment shall become effective, the members of the commission shall
be appointed at the next regular session of the legislature. The original members of the
commission shall serve for the remainder of their elected terms of office as members of the
legislature, and the terms of office of members of the commission shall thereafter correspond to
the full four-year terms for which members of the legislature are elected. If at any time there shall
be a vacancy among the appointed members of the commission, a successor shall be appointed
from the same body of the legislature as that to which the previous incumbent belonged, and such
successor shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term of such previous incumbent.

(b) The commission shall hold an organizational meeting at the state capitol within ten (10) days
after the appointment of the original members thereof, and shall elect a chairman and vice
chairman from among its members. Thereafter, the commission shall meet, from time to time, at
the call of the chairman or vice chairman or upon the request of seven or more members, with
such notice and in accordance with such procedure as shall be prescribed by the rules of the
commission.

(c) The commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure for the transaction of business, except
as otherwise provided in this amendment. A majority of the members of the commission shall
constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting any business or performing any authorized
duties. All members of the commission, including both those who serve ex officio and
those who are appointed, shall have an equal vote. The commission shall keep full and complete
minutes in writing of its proceedings, and every action taken shall be authorized by duly adopted
resolution recorded in such minutes.

(d) Each member of the commission shall be entitled to his or her regular legislative
compensation and per diem and travel expenses for each day he or she attends a meeting or
conducts business of the commission, and such compensation and expenses shall be paid as
provided by law out of the funds from time to time appropriated by the legislature to pay the
expenses of administering the trust fund.

(e) The commission shall monitor and evaluate the management of the trust fund by the board,
shall report to the legislature on both the present and future availability of trust income for
appropriation by the legislature, and shall recommend to the legislature the enactment of such
laws respecting the trust fund as the commission shall deem desirable; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this amendment respecting the commission shall be construed to
authorize the legislature to enact laws inconsistent with the express provisions of this
amendment.

Section 9. Amendment Self-Executing. This amendment shall be self-executing, but the
legislature shall have the right and power to enact laws supplemental to this amendment and in
furtherance of the purposes and objectives thereof, provided that such laws are not inconsistent
with the express provisions of this amendment.

Issuance of Interest Bearing Bonds for Specified Purposes.

The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue its interest bearing
bonds, in addition to all other bonds of the state, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding
$520,000,000. The expenses incurred in the sale and issuance of said bonds shall be paid out of
the proceeds derived from the sale thereof. The proceeds of said bonds shall be paid into the state
treasury, shall be kept continually invested pending the expenditure thereof, and shall, together
with the income derived from the investment and reinvestment thereof (including income derived
from the investment and reinvestment of previously derived income), be retained in one or more
separate accounts of the state treasury until expended for the purposes authorized in this
amendment and in the manner provided by law. The proceeds of said bonds remaining after
payment of the expenses of selling and issuing the same, together with the investment income
derived from said proceeds, shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the capital costs of
public facilities and works of internal improvement consisting of (i) public roads, streets,
highways and bridges, (ii) buildings, equipment and other facilities for public schools, public
technical and vocational schools and public institutions of higher education, (iii) state prisons,
facilities
for the housing, training, education or rehabilitation of prisoners, and other facilities necessary or
useful in connection with prisons and other penal or correctional facilities, (iv) mental hospitals
and other mental health facilities, (v) the improvement of navigation in Mobile Harbor by the
deepening and widening of channels therein and the construction and installation of dock and
wharf facilities in Mobile Harbor and on navigable inland waterways, (vi) the renovation and
restoration of buildings in the main governmental complex of the state, including the State
Capitol Building and the present headquarters office building of the state highway department,
(vii) the construction and equipment of a new headquarters office building for the state highway
department, (viii) facilities for the Alabama department of youth services, (ix) the renovation and
restoration of the State Coliseum in Montgomery county, (x) public parks and park facilities, the

and natural resources, the planting of shells to be used as mulch for the improvement of oyster
cultivation and other maricultural activities in Alabama coastal waters, bays and sounds, and (xi)
equipment for the Alabama Educational Television Commission.

The legislature shall enact appropriate implementing laws to provide for the sale and issuance of
the bonds authorized by this amendment, to appropriate and allocate the proceeds thereof,
together with the investment income derived from said proceeds, among the hereinbefore
described purposes, and otherwise to carry out the intent and purpose of this
amendment.

The state of Alabama is also authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue one or more
series of bonds to refund all or any of the bonds authorized by this amendment in such principal
amount or amounts (which may exceed the principal amount of the bonds being refunded) and in
such manner as may be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature.

All bonds issued pursuant to this amendment (including refunding bonds) may be sold at public
or private sale, with or without competitive bidding, to such person or persons, at such price or
prices and upon such terms as the governor, the director of finance and the state treasurer shall
determine to be in the best interests of the state. All such bonds (including refunding bonds) shall
be direct, general obligations of the state, and the full faith and credit of the state are hereby
irrevocably pledged for the prompt and faithful payment of the principal of said bonds and the
interest and premium (if any) thereon.

AMENDMENT 396 RATIFIED 1982

Payment by State of Expenses Incurred by Alabama Housing Finance Authority.

Any provision of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 or amendments thereto to the contrary
notwithstanding, the legislature may from time to time by law provide for the payment by the
state of Alabama of expenses incurred by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority (organized
pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 80-585 enacted at the 1980 Regular Session of the
legislature) in the exercise of the powers granted to it by law, including, but without limitation,
expenses incurred by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority in the issuance of its bonds and
the utilization of the proceeds therefrom to make or acquire mortgage loans to private persons,
firms or corporations that are secured by mortgages on single or multi-family residential property
located in the state. The legislature may appropriate moneys from any available source for the
direct payment of such expenses or it may authorize the transfer of moneys to the Alabama
Housing Finance Authority to be used for that purpose. Notwithstanding the payment by the
state, either directly or indirectly, in any manner authorized herein, of the expenses incurred by
the Alabama Housing Finance Authority, no bonds or others evidences of indebtedness issued by
the Alabama Housing Finance Authority shall be deemed to constitute an indebtedness of the
state within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory provision whatsoever, nor shall any action taken by the Alabama
Housing Finance Authority be deemed to constitute a lending of money or credit by the state to
any individual, association, or corporation, or a participation by the state in works of internal
improvement, within the meaning of Section 93 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as
amended.

This amendment shall have no force and effect after December 31, 1983, and shall not constitute
a part of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 after such date, but the expiration thereof on such
date shall not be considered by any court as a reason for holding unconstitutional any law which
would have been constitutional without the adoption of this amendment.

Amendment of Section 110.

SECTION 110

"General law," "local law" and "special law" defined.

A general law is a law which in its terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or
more municipalities of the state less than the whole in a class. A general law applicable to such a
class of municipalities shall define the class on the basis of criteria reasonably related to the
purpose of the law, provided that the legislature may also enact and change from time to time a
general schedule of not more than eight classes of municipalities based on population according
to any designated federal decennial census, and general laws for any purpose may thereafter be
enacted for any such class. Any law heretofore enacted which complies with the provisions of
this section shall be considered a general law.

No general law which at the time of its enactment applies to only one municipality of the state
shall be enacted, unless notice of the intention to apply therefor shall have been given and shown
as provided in Section 106 of this Constitution for special, private or local laws; provided, that
such notice shall not be deemed to constitute such law a local law.

A special or private law is one which applies to an individual, association or corporation. A local

Amendment of Section 264.

SECTION 264

Board of trustees of state university.

The state university shall be under the management and control of a board of trustees, which
shall consist of two members from each congressional district in the state, an additional member
from the congressional district which includes the site of the first campus of the university, the
superintendent of education, and the governor, who shall be ex officio president of the
board. The members of the board of trustees as now constituted shall hold office until their
respective terms expire under existing law, and until their successors shall be elected and
confirmed as hereinafter required. The additional trustees provided for by this amendment shall
be elected by the existing members of the board, and confirmed by the senate in the manner
provided below, for initial terms of not more than six years established by the board so that one
term shall expire each three years in each congressional district. Successors to the terms of the
existing and additional trustees shall hold office for a term of six years, and shall not serve more
than three consecutive full six-year terms on the board; provided however that a trustee shall
retire from the board and vacate office at the annual meeting of the board following that trustee's
seventieth birthday. Election of additional and successor trustees or of trustees to fill any vacancy
created by the expiration of a term or by the death or resignation of any member or from any
other cause shall be by the remaining members of the board by secret ballot; provided, that any
trustee so elected shall hold office from the date of election until confirmation or rejection by the
senate, and, if confirmed, until the expiration of the term for which elected, and until a successor
is elected. At every meeting of the legislature the superintendent of education shall certify to the
senate the names of all who shall have been so elected since the last session of the legislature,
and the senate shall confirm or reject them, as it shall determine is for the best interest of the
university. If it rejects the names of any members, it shall thereupon elect trustees in the stead of
those rejected. No trustee shall receive any pay or emolument other than his actual expenses
incurred in the discharge of his duties as such. Upon the vacation of office by a trustee, the board,
if it desires, may bestow upon a trustee the honorary title of trustee emeritus, but such status shall
confer no responsibilities, duties, rights, or privileges as such.

products. The legislature may make provisions for the nonpayment of assessments by swine
producers and shall make provisions for the refund of assessments to any swine producer
dissatisfied with the assessment program. The legislature shall provide for the collection and
distribution of any such assessments or charges by dealers, handlers, processors and purchasers
of swine and swine products and provide penalties for failure to make collection and distribution
of such assessments. The legislature shall provide for the designation of a nonprofit association
or organization organized for the promotion and betterment of swine and swine products to
administer and carry out such promotional program which shall include the conducting of
elections or referendums among swine producers. The legislature may provide the manner by
which such referendum is held, including the procedure for application for approval to conduct
the referendum, the appropriate action to be taken by the state board of agriculture and industries
on such application, the requirements and eligibility of the association or organization which will
conduct such referendum, the procedures for voting and eligibility to vote in such referendum
and the details of the conduct of such referendum. The legislature shall further provide for the
deposit, withdrawal, disbursement and expenditure by the designated association of any funds
received subject to the supervision and control of the activities as authorized herein by the
department of agriculture and industries and the state board of agriculture and industries. The
legislature shall further provide a procedure whereby said association or organization is bonded,
for the examination and auditing of said association or organization, and for reasonably necessary
rules and regulations to be adopted by the state board of agriculture and industries to effectively
carry out the intent and purposes herein enumerated. Assessments, fees or other charges collected
as authorized by any legislative act adopted in pursuance hereof shall not be considered as a tax
