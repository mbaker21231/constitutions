signers of said petition eight per cent of the legal voters in such county, and every such petition

All elections on measures referred to the people of the State shall be had at the biennial regular

passed upon at an election, and the result has been determined and declared as provided by law.
The whole number of votes cast for Governor at the regular election last preceding the filing of

petitions and orders for the Initiative and for the Referendum shall be filed with the Secretary of
State; and in submitting the same to the people, he, and all other officers, shall be guided by the
General laws and the Act submitting this amendment, until legislation shall be especially
provided therefor. The enacting clause of every law originated by the Initiative shall be as
follows:

"Be it enacted by the People of Montana:"
