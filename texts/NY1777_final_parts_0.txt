CONSTITUTION OF NEW YORK-1777

*** ASTART 9001.0 NY 1777 ***

IN CONVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
Kingston, 20th April, 1777.


Whereas the many  tyrannical and oppressive usurpations of the King and Parliament of Great Britain
on the rights and liberties of the people of the American colonies had reduced them to the necessity of
introducing a government by congresses and committees, as temporary expedients, and to exist no
longer than the grievances of the people should remain without redress; And whereas the congress of
the colony of New York did, on the thirty-first day of May now last past, resolve as follows, viz:

" Whereas the present government of this colony, by congress and committees, was instituted while the
former government, under the Crown of Great Britain, existed in full force, and was established for the
sole purpose of opposing the usurpation of the British Parliament, and was intended to expire on a
reconciliation with Great Britain, which it was then apprehended would soon take place, but is now
considered as remote and uncertain;

"And whereas many and great inconveniences attend the said mode of government by congress and
committees, as of necessity, in many instances, legislative, judicial, and executive powers have been
vested therein, especially since the dissolution of the former government by the abdication of the late
governor and the exclusion of this colony from the protection of the King of Great Britain;

"And whereas the Continental Congress did resolve as followeth, to wit:

"' Whereas His Britannic Majesty, in conjunction with the lords and commons of Great Britain, has, by
a  late act of Parliament, excluded the inhabitants of these united colonies from the protection of his
Crown; and whereas no answers whatever to the humble petition of the colonies for redress of
grievances and reconciliation with Great Britain has been, or is likely to be, given, but the whole force
of that kingdom, aided by foreign mercenaries, is to be exerted for the destruction of the good people
of these colonies; and whereas it appears absolutely irreconcilable to reason and good conscience for
the people of these colonies now to take the oaths and affirmations necessary for the support of any
government under the Crown of Great Britain, and it  is necessary that the  exercise of every kind of
authority under the said Crown should be totally suppressed, and all the powers of government exerted
under the authority of the people of the colonies for the preservation of internal peace, virtue, and good
order, as well as for the defense of our lives, liberties, and properties, against the hostile invasions and
cruel depredations of our enemies: Therefore,

" ' Resolved, That it be recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of the united
colonies, where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs has been hitherto established,
to adopt such government as shall, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to
the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and America in general.'

"And whereas doubts have arisen whether this congress are invested with sufficient power and authority
to deliberate and determine on so important a subject as the necessity of erecting and constituting a new
form of government and internal police, to the exclusion of all foreign jurisdiction, dominion, and control
whatever; and whereas it appertains of right solely to the people of this colony to determine the said
doubts: Therefore,

" Resolved, That  it be recommended to the electors in the several counties in this colony, by election,
in the manner and form prescribed for the election of the present congress, either to authorize ( in addi-

tion to the powers vested in this congress) their present deputies, or others in the stead of their present
deputies, or either of them, to take into consideration the necessity and propriety of instituting such new
government as in and by the said resolution of the Continental Congress is described and
recommended; and if the majority of the counties, by their deputies in provincial congress, shall be of
opinion that such new government ought to be instituted and established, then to institute and establish
such a government as they shall deem best calculated to secure the rights, liberties, and happiness of the
good people of this colony; and to continue in force until a future peace with Great Britain shall render
the same unnecessary; and

" Resolved, That the said elections in the several counties ought to be had on such day, and at such
place or places, as by the committee of each county respectively shall be determined. And it is recom-

mended to the said committees to fix such early days for the said elections as that all the deputies to be
elected have sufficient time to repair to the city of New York by the second Monday in July next; on
which day all the said deputies ought punctually to give their attendance.

" And whereas the object of the aforegoing resolutions is of the utmost  importance to the good people
of  this colony:

" Resolved, That it be, and it is hereby, earnestly recommended to the committees, freeholders, and
other electors in the different counties in this colony  diligently to carry the same into execution."

And whereas the good people of the said colony, in pursuance of the said resolution, and reposing
special trust and confidence in the members of this convention, have appointed, authorized, and em-

powered them for the purposes, and in the manner, and with the powers in and by the said resolve
specified, declared, and mentioned.

And whereas the Delegates of the United American States, in general Congress convened, did, on the
fourth day of July now last past., solemnly publish and declare, in the words following, viz:

" When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the
separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation.

" We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their
Creator  with certain unalienable rights; that among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
that to, secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government  becomes destructive of these ends, it
is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation
on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient causes, and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such government, and to provide new guards, for their future security. Such has been the
patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
former system of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these
States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

" He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

" He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended
in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, lie has utterly neglected to
attend to them.

" He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature; a right inestimable to them, and
formidable to tyrants only.

" He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
measures.

" He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on
the rights of the people.

" He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the
legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the
State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions
within.

"He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for
naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the
conditions of new appropriations of lands.

"He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary
powers.

"He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount of the
payment of their salaries.

"He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and
eat out their substance.

" He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.

"He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.

" He has combined  with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and
unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:

" For quartering large bodies of troops among us:

" For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders they should commit on the
inhabitants of these States:

"For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:

"For imposing taxes on us without our consent:


"For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury: 
  
"For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences:

" For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an
arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit 
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:

"For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms
of our governments:

" For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us
in all cases whatsoever.

" He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.

" He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
people.

" He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the work of death,
desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in
the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

" He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their
country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

" He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of
our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

" In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms. Our
repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus
marked by every act  which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.


" Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to
time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded
them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native
justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow
these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have
been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity
which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war; in
peace, friends.

" We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in general Congress assembled,
appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our  intentions, do, in the name and by
the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united
colonies are, and of right ought, to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all
allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as free and independent States they have full
power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and
things which independent States may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our
fortunes, and our sacred honor."

And whereas this convention, having taken this declaration into their most serious consideration, did, on
the ninth day of July last past, unanimously resolve that the reasons assigned *by the Continental
Congress for declaring the united colonies  free and independent States are cogent and conclusive; and
that while we lament the cruel necessity which has rendered that measure unavoidable, we approve the
same, and will, at the risk of our lives and fortunes, join with the other colonies in supporting it.

By virtue of which several acts, declarations, and proceedings mentioned and contained in the afore-
cited resolves or resolutions of the general Congress of the United American States, and of the con-

gresses or conventions of this State, all power whatever therein hath reverted to the people thereof, and
this convention hath by their suffrages and free choice been appointed, and among other things
authorized to institute and establish such a government as they shall deem best calculated to secure the
rights and liberties of the good people of this State, most conducive of the happiness and safety of their
constituents in particular, and of America in general.

I. This convention, therefore in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, doth

II. This convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State,
ordain, determine, and declare that the supreme legislative power within this State shall be vested in two

III. And whereas laws inconsistent with the spirit of this constitution, or with the public good, may be
hastily and unadvisedly passed: Be it ordained, that the governor for the time being, the chancellor, and
the judges of the supreme court, or any two of them, together with the governor, shall be, and hereby
are, constituted a council to revise all bills about to be passed into laws by the legislature; and for that
purpose shall assemble themselves from time to time, when the legislature shall be convened; for which,
nevertheless, they shall not receive any salary or consideration, under any pretence whatever. And that
all bills which have passed the senate and assembly  shall, before they become laws, be presented to
the said council for their revisal and consideration; and if, upon such revision and consideration, it 
should appear improper to the said council, or a majority of them, that the said bill should become a
law of this State, that they return the same, together with their objections thereto in writing, to the senate
or house of assembly (in which soever the same shall have originated) who shall enter the objection sent
down by the council at large in their minutes, and proceed to reconsider the said bill. But  if,  after such
reconsideration, two-thirds of the said senate or house of assembly shall, notwithstanding the said
objections, agree to pass the same, it  shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of
the legislature, where  it shall also be reconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of the members
present, shall be a law.

And in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, be it further ordained, that if any bill shall not be
returned by the council within ten days after it shall have been presented, the same shall be a law, unless
the legislature shall, by their adjournment, render a return of the said bill within ten days impracticable;
in which case the bill shall be returned on the first day of the meeting of the legislature after the
expiration of the said ten days.

V. That as soon after the expiration of seven years (subsequent to the termination of the present war) as
may be a census of the electors and inhabitants in this State be taken, under the direction of the
legislature. And if, on such census, it shall appear that the number of representatives in assembly from
the, said counties is not justly proportioned to the number of electors in the said counties respectively,
that the legislature do adjust and apportion the same by that rule. And further, that once in ever seven
years, after the taking of the said first census, a just account of the electors resident  in each county shall
be taken, and if it shall thereupon appear that the number of electors in any county  shall have increased
or diminished one. or more seventieth parts of the whole number of electors, which, on the said first
census, shall be found in this State, the number of representatives for such county shall be increased or
diminished accordingly, that is to say, one representative for every seventieth part as aforesaid.

VI. And whereas an opinion hath long prevailed among divers of the good people of this State that
voting at elections by ballot would tend more to preserve the liberty and equal freedom of the people
than voting viva voce:  To the end, therefore, that a fair experiment be made, which of those two
methods of voting is to be preferred -- 
Be it ordained, That as soon as may  be after the termination of the present war between the United
States of America and Great Britain, an act or acts be passed by the legislature of this State for causing
all elections thereafter to be held in this State for senators and representatives in assembly to be by
ballot, and directing the manner in which the same shall be conducted.  And whereas it is possible that,
after all the care of the legislature in framing the said act or acts, certain inconveniences and mischiefs,
unforseen at this day, may be found to attend the said mode of electing by ballot :
It is further ordained, That if, after a full and fair experiment shall be made of voting by ballot
aforesaid, the same shall be found less conducive to the safety or interest of the State than the method
of voting viva voce,  it shall be lawful and constitutional for the legislature to abolish the same, provided
two-thirds of the members present in each house, respectively, shall concur therein. And further, that,
during the continuance of the present war, and until the legislature of this State shall provide for the
election of senators and representatives in assembly by ballot, the said election shall be made viva
voce.

Tryon County; and the eastern district, the counties of Charlotte, Cumberland, and Gloucester. That the
senators shall be elected by the freeholders of the said districts qualified as aforesaid, in the proportions
following, to wit:: in the southern district, nine; in the middle district, six; in the western district, six; and
in the eastern district, three..  And be it  ordained, that a census shall be taken, as soon as may be after
the expiration of seven years from the termination of the present war, under the direction of the
legislature; and if, on such census, it shall appear that the number of senators is not justly proportioned
to the several districts, that the legislature adjust the proportion, as near as may be, to the number of
freeholders, qualified as aforesaid, in each district. That when the number of electors, within any of the
said districts, shall have increased one twenty-fourth part of the whole number of electors, which, by
the said census' shall be found to be in this State,, an additional senator shall be chosen by the electors
of such district. That a majority of the number of senators to be chosen aforesaid shall be necessary to
constitute a, senate sufficient to proceed upon business; and that the senate shall, in like manner with the
assembly, be the judges of its own members. And be it ordained, that  it, shall be in the power of the
future legislatures of this State for the convenience and advantage of the good people thereof, to divide
