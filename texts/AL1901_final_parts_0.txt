hundred and three, all electors shall be registered under and in accordance with the requirements
of this section, as follows:

First - Registration shall be conducted in each county by a board of three reputable and suitable 
persons resident in the county, who shall not hold any elective office during their term, to be
appointed within sixty days after the ratification of this Constitution, by the Governor, Auditor
and Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries, or by a majority of them, acting as a board of
appointment. If one or more of the persons appointed on such board of registration shall refuse,
neglect, or be unable to qualify or serve, or if a vacancy or vacancies occur in the membership of
the board of registrars from any cause, the Governor, Auditor and Commissioner of Agriculture
and Industries, or a majority of them, acting as a board of appointment, shall make other
appointments to fill such board. Each registrar shall receive two dollars per day, to be paid by
the State, and disbursed by the several Judges of Probate, for each entire day's attendance upon
the sessions of the board. Before entering upon the performance of the duties of his office, each
registrar shall take the same oath required of the judicial officers of the State, which oath may be
administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths.  The oath shall be in writing
and subscribed by the registrar, and filed in the office of the Judge of Probate of the county.

Second - Prior to the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, the Board of Registrars in
each county shall visit each precinct at least once, and oftener, if necessary to make a complete
registration of all persons entitled to register, and shall remain there at least one day from eight
o'clock in the morning until sunset. They shall give at least twenty days' notice of the time when,
and the place in the precinct where, they will attend to register applicants for registration, by bills
posted at five or more public places in each election precinct, and by advertisement once a week
for three successive weeks in a newspaper, if there be one published in the county. Upon failure to
give such notice, or to attend any appointment made by them in any precinct, they shall, after like
notice, fill new appointments therein; but the time consumed by the board in completing such
registration shall not exceed sixty working days in any county, except that in counties of more
than nine hundred square miles in area, such board may consume seventy-five working days in
completing the registration, and except that in counties in which there is any city of eight
thousand or more inhabitants, the board may remain in Session, in addition to the time
hereinbefore prescribed, not more than three successive weeks in each of such cities; and
thereafter the board may sit from time to time in each of such cities not more than one week in
each month, and except that in the county of Jefferson the board may hold an additional session of
not exceeding five consecutive days duration for each session, in each town or city of more than
one thousand and less than eight thousand inhabitants. No person shall be registered except
at the county site or in the precinct in which he resides. The registrars shall issue to each person
registered a certificate of registration.

Third - The Board of Registrars shall not register any person between the first day of August,
nineteen hundred and two, and the Friday next preceding the day of election in November,
nineteen hundred and two. On Friday and Saturday next preceding the day of election in
November, nineteen hundred and two, they shall sit in the court house of each county during such
days, and shall register all applicants having the qualifications prescribed by Section 180 of this
Constitution, and not disqualified under Section 182, who shall have reached the age of
twenty-one years after the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, or who shall prove to
the reasonable satisfaction of the board that, by reason of physical disability or unavoidable
absence from the county, they had no opportunity to register prior to the first day of August,
nineteen hundred and two, and they shall not on such days register any other persons. When there
are two or more court houses in a county, the registrars may sit during such two days at the court
house they may select, but shall give ten days' notice, by bills posted at each of the court houses,
designating the court house at which they will sit.


Fourth - The Board of Registrars shall hold sessions at the court house of their respective
counties during the entire third week in November, nineteen hundred and two, and for six
working days next prior to the twentieth day of December nineteen hundred and two, during
which sessions they shall register all persons applying who possess the qualifications prescribed in
Section 180 of this Constitution, and who shall not be disqualified under Section 182. In counties
where there are more than two court houses the Board of Registrars shall divide the time equally
between them. The Board of Registrars shall give notice of the time and place of such sessions by
posting notices at each court house in their respective counties, and at each voting place and at
three other public places in the county, and by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks
in a newspaper, if one be published in the county; such notices to be posted and such publications
to be commenced as early as practicable in the first week of November, nineteen hundred and
two. Failure on the part of the registrars to conform to the provisions of this article as to the
giving of the required notices shall not invalidate any registration made by them. 

Fifth - The Board of Registrars shall have power to examine, under oath or affirmation, all
applicants for registration, and to take testimony touching the qualifications of such applicants.
Each member of such board is authorized to administer the oath to be taken by the applicants and
witnesses, which shall be in the following form, and subscribed by the person making it, and
preserved by the board, namely: "I solemnly swear (or affirm) that in the matter of the application
of ____ ____ for registration as an elector, I will speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help me God." Any person who upon such examination makes any wilfully false
statement in reference to any material matter touching the qualification of any applicant for
registration, shall be guilty of perjury, and upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned in the
penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five years.


Sixth - The action of the majority of the Board of Registrars shall be the action of the board and a
majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business. Any person to
whom registration is denied shall have the right of appeal, without giving security for costs, within
thirty days after such denial, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court or court of like jurisdiction
held for the county in which he seeks to register, to have his qualifications as an elector
determined. Upon the filing of the petition the clerk of the court shall give notice thereof to any
Solicitor authorized to represent the State in said county, whose duty it shall be to appear and
defend against the petition on behalf of the State. Upon such trial the court shall charge the jury
only as to what constitutes the qualifications that entitle the applicant to become an elector
at the time he applied for registration, and the jury shall determine the weight and effect of the
evidence and return a verdict. From the judgment rendered an appeal will lie to the Supreme
Court in favor of the petitioner, to be taken within thirty days. Final judgment in favor of the
petitioner shall entitle him to registration as of the date of his application to the registrars.


Seventh - The Secretary of State shall, at the expense of the State, have prepared and shall furnish
to the registrars and judges of probate of the several counties a sufficient number of registration
books and of blank forms of the oath, certificates of registration and notices required to be given
by the registrars. The cost of the publication in newspapers of the notices required to be given by
the registrars shall be paid by the State, the bills therefor to be rendered to the Secretary of State
and approved by him.

Eighth - Any person who registers for another, or who registers more than once, and any registrar
who enters the name of any person on the list of registered voters, without such person having
made application in person under oath on a form provided for that purpose, or who knowingly
registers any person more than once, or who knowingly enters a name upon the registration list as
the name of a voter, without any one of that name applying to register, shall be guilty of a felony,
and upon conviction thereof shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more
than five years.

provisions of this article, any one who shall register prior to the first day of January, nineteen

certificate. The certificate of the registrars or of the Judge of Probate or of the Secretary of State
