        CONSTITUTION OF NEW JERSEY-1776 
        
*** ASTART 9001.0 NJ 1776 ***

WHEREAS all the constitutional authority ever possessed by the kings of Great Britain over these
colonies, or their other dominions, was, by compact, derived from the people, and held of them, for
the common interest of the whole society; allegiance and protection are, in the nature of things,
reciprocal ties, each equally depending on the other, and liable to be dissolved by the others being
refused or withdrawn. And whereas George the Third, king of Great Britain, has refused protection
to the good people of these colonies; and, by assenting to sundry acts of the British parliament,
attempted to subject them to the absolute dominion of that body; and has also made war upon them,
in the most cruel and unnatural manner, for no other cause, than asserting their just rights all civil
authority under him is necessarily at an end, and a dissolution of government in each colony has
consequently, taken place.
And whereas, in the present deplorable situation of these colonies, exposed to the fury of a cruel
and relentless enemy, some form of government is absolutely necessary, not only for the preservation
of good order, but also the more effectually to unite the people, and enable them to exert their whole
force in their own necessary defence: and as the honorable the continental congress, the supreme
council of the American colonies, has advised such of the colonies as have not yet gone into
measures, to adopt for themselves, respectively, such government as shall best conduce to their own
happiness and safety, and the well-being of America in general:
 We, the representatives of the Colony of New Jersey, having been elected by all the counties, in
the freest manner, and in congress assembled, have, after mature deliberations, agreed upon a set of
charter rights and the form of a Constitution, in manner following, viz.

*** AEND ***

*** ASTART 002.0 NJ 1776 ***

II. That the Legislative Council, and General Assembly, shall be chosen, for the first time on the
second Tuesday in August next; the members whereof shall be the same in number and qualifications
as are herein after mentioned; and shall be and remain vested with all the powers and authority to be
held by any future Legislative Council and Assembly of this Colony, until the second Tuesday in
October, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.

*** AEND ***

*** ASTART 003.0 NJ 1776 ***

                                   III. That on the second Tuesday in October yearly, and every year forever (with the privilege of
adjourning from day to day as occasion may require) the counties shall severally choose one
person, to be a member of the Legislative Council of this Colony, who shall be, and have been, for
one whole year next before the election, an inhabitant and freeholder in the county in which he is
chosen, and worth at least one thousand pounds proclamation money, of real and personal estate,
within the same county; that, at the same time, each county shall also choose three members of
Assembly; provided that no person shall be entitled to a seat in the said Assembly unless he be,
and have been, for one whole year next before the election, an inhabitant of the county he is to
represent, and worth five hundred pounds proclamation money, in real and personal estate, in the
same county: that on the second Tuesday next after the day of election, the Council and Assembly
shall separately meet; and that the consent of both Houses shall be necessary to every law;
provided, that seven shall be a quorum of the Council, for doing business, and that no law shall
pass, unless there be a majority of all the Representatives of each body personally present, and
agreeing thereto. Provided always, that if a majority of the representatives of this Province, in
Council and General Assembly convened, shall, at any time or times hereafter, judge it equitable
and proper, to add to or diminish the number or proportion of the members of Assembly for any
county or counties in this Colony, then, and in such case, the same may, on the principles of more,
equal representation, be lawfully done; anything in this Charter to the contrary not withstanding:
so that the whole number of Representatives in Assembly shall not, at any time, be less than
thirty-nine.
