citizens, none of whom is a justice, judge or magistrate of any court or licensed to practice law in
this

In accordance with this section, any justice, judge or magistrate of any court may be disciplined
or removed for willful misconduct in office or willful and persistent failure to perform his duties
or habitual intemperance, or he may be retired for disability seriously interfering with the
performance of his duties which is, or is likely to become of a permanent character. The
commission may, after investigation it deems necessary, order a hearing to be held before it
concerning the discipline, removal or retirement of a justice, judge or magistrate, or the
commission may appoint three masters who are justices or judges of courts of record to hear and
take evidence in the matter and to report their findings to the commission. After hearing or after

retirement as it finds just arid proper or wholly reject the recommendation. Upon an order for his
retirement,         any justice, judge or magistrate participating in a statutory retirement program
shall be retired with the same rights as it he had retired pursuant to the retirement program. Upon
an order for removal, the justice, judge or magistrate shall thereby be removed from office, and
his salary shall cease from the date of the order.
All papers filed with the commission or its masters, and proceedings before the commission or
its masters, are confidential. The filing of papers and giving of testimony before the commission

character, and
a writing which was privileged prior to its tiling with the commission or its masters does not lose
its privilege by the filing. The commission shall promulgate regulations establishing procedures

Article 6, section 32
32.  There is created the "judicial standards commission", consisting of two justices or judges,
one magistrate and two lawyers selected as may be provided by law to serve for terms of four
years, and six citizens, none of whom is a justice, judge or magistrate of any court or licensed to
practice law in this state, who shall be appointed by the governor for five-year staggered terms as
may be provided by law.  If a position on the commission becomes vacant for any reason, the
successor shall be selected by the original appointing authority in the same manner as the original
appointment was made and shall serve for the remainder of the term vacated.  No act of the
commission is valid unless concurred in by a majority of its members.
   The commission shall select one of the members appointed by the governor to serve as
chairman.
   In accordance with this section, any justice, judge or magistrate of any court may be disciplined
or removed for willful misconduct in office, persistent failure or inability to perform a judge's
duties, or habitual intemperance, or he may be retired for disability seriously interfering with the
performance of his duties that is, or is likely to become, of a permanent character.  The
commission may, after investigation it deems necessary, order a hearing to be held before it
concerning the discipline, removal or retirement of a justice, judge or magistrate, or the
commission may appoint three masters who are justices or judges of courts of record to hear and
take evidence in the matter and to report their findings to the commission.  After hearing or after
considering the record and the findings and report of the masters, if the commission finds good
cause, it shall recommend to the supreme court the discipline, removal or retirement of the
justice, judge or magistrate.
   The supreme court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and may
permit the introduction of additional evidence, and it shall order the discipline, removal or
retirement as it finds just and proper or wholly reject the recommendation.  Upon an order for his
retirement, any justice, judge or magistrate participating in a statutory retirement program shall
be retired with the same rights as if he had retired pursuant to the retirement program.  Upon an
order for removal, the justice, judge or magistrate shall thereby be removed from office, and his
salary cease from the date of the order.
   All papers filed with the commission or its masters, and proceedings before the commission or
its masters, are confidential.  The filing of papers and giving of testimony before the commission
or its masters is privileged in any action for defamation, except that the record filed by the
commission in the supreme court continues privileged but, upon its filing, loses its confidential
character, and a writing which was privileged prior to its filing with the commission or its
masters does not lose its privilege by the filing.  The commission shall promulgate regulations
establishing procedures for hearings under this section.  No justice or judge who is a member of
the commission or supreme court shall participate in any proceeding involving his own
discipline, removal or retirement.
   This section is alternative to, and cumulative with, the removal of justices, judges and
magistrates by impeachment and the original superintending control of the supreme court.

would be a new section 10, but the former compiler so designated it, and the present compiler
has left it as such for the sake of consistency.
