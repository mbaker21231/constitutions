removed from office for willful or persistent failure to perform his duties or habitual intemperance
or conduct unbecoming a member of the judiciary or he may be involuntarily retired for disability
seriously interfering with the performance of his duties, which is, or is likely to become,
permanent in nature.  After such investigation as it deems necessary, the judicial qualifications
commission may conduct a hearing concerning the removal, discipline or retirement of a justice or
judge or request the supreme court to appoint three special referees, who shall be active or retired
justices or judges of courts of record, to hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report
thereon to the commission.  All hearings shall be held in the county in which the justice or judge
involved resides.  Testimony shall be under oath, administered by a member of the commission or
a special referee, and subject to the penalties for perjury.  If after hearing, or after considering the
record and report of the referees, the commission finds good cause therefor, it shall recommend to
the supreme court the removal, discipline or retirement of the justice or judge.  The supreme court
shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and shall order removal, discipline
or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the commission's recommendation. 
Upon an order for involuntary retirement for disability, the justice or judge shall thereby be retired
at retirement pay to be fixed by law which as to a justice of the supreme court, judge of a district
court of appeal or circuit judge shall not be less than two thirds of his then compensation if he has
served for ten years or more as justice or judge of such court or courts.  Upon an order for
removal, the justice or judge shall thereby be removed from office, and his salary shall cease from
the date of such order.  The supreme court shall make rules providing for the procedure before
the commission and the referees and the extent to which communications shall be privileged or
confidential, provided that upon the entry of an order of discipline, removal or retirement the
record shall no longer remain confidential.  A justice or judge shall be disqualified in any
proceeding involving his own discipline, retirement or removal.  The supreme court shall by rule
provide for the disqualification of any member of the commission or referee and for the ad hoc
appointment of a person to take the place of a disqualified person.

cent of the pledged revenues.

(c) The state may lease any of such facilities to any local governmental agency, under lease-
purchase agreements for such periods and under such other terms and conditions as may be
mutually agreed upon. The local governmental agencies may pledge the revenues derived from

agencies, for the construction of such facilities to be owned or operated by any of such local
governmental agencies. Such loans shall bear interest at not more than one-half of one per cent

(1) A state tax, designated "second gas tax" of two cents (2c) per gallon upon gasoline and other
like products of petroleum and an equivalent tax upon other sources of energy used to propel
motor vehicles as levied by Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is
hereby continued for a period of forty (40) consecutive years.  The proceeds of said tax shall be
placed monthly in the state roads distribution fund in the state treasury.

(2) Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this reference
as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the "second gas tax" as
referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the formula
stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders
of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof secured by
any portion of the "second gas tax."

(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in Article IX, Section 16, of the
Constitution, on of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter
issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging
revenues allocated under said Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded at a lower net average
interest cost rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations
refunded, secured by the same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this
subsection.

(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and after payment of
administrative expenses, the "second gas tax" shall be allocated to the account of each of the
several counties in amounts to be determined as follows: There shall be an initial allocation of
one-fourth (1/4) in the ratio of county area to state area, one-fourth (1/4) in the ratio of the total
county population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available
federal census, and one-half (1/2) in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales
or use in each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal
year. If the annual debt service requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including
any deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the
amount which would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph, the
amounts allocated to other counties shall be reduced proportionately.

(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by the
state board of administration created under said Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of
1885, as amended, and which is continued as a body corporate for the life of this subsection 9(c). 
The board shall remit the proceeds of the "second gas tax" in each county account for use in said
county as follows: eighty percent (80%) to the state agency supervising the state road system and
twenty percent (20%) to the governing body of the county. The percentage allocated to the
county may be increased by general law. The proceeds of the "second gas tax" subject to
allocation to the several counties under this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of
obligations pledging revenues allocated pursuant to Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of
1885, as amended, and any refundings thereof; second, for the payment of debt service on bonds
issued as provided by this paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as
defined by law; and third, for the acquisition and construction of roads. When authorized by law,
state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be issued without any election: (i) to
refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to a county under
Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended; (ii) to finance the acquisition and
construction of roads in a county when approved by the governing body of the county and the
state agency supervising the state road system; and (iii) to refund obligations secured by any
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued
unless a state fiscal agency created by law has made a determination that in no state fiscal year
will the debt service requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion
of the "second gas tax" allocated to the county exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the pledged
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county, for the preceding state fiscal year, of the
pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding state fiscal year and of the
annual average net tolls anticipated during the first (5) years of operation of new projects to be
financed. Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be payable primarily from the pledged
tolls and portions of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county.

(1) Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this Constitution, as amended, (which, by reference,
adopted Article XII, Section 18, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended) as the same existed
immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as part of this
amendment as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of providing
that after the effective date of this amendment the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the
licensing of motor vehicles as referred to therein shall be distributed annually among the several
counties in the ratio of the number of instruction units in each county, the same being coterminus
with the school district of each county as provided in Article IX, Section 4, Subsection (a) of this
Constitution, in each year computed as provided therein to the extent necessary to comply with all
obligations to or for the benefits of holders of bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates
issued before the effective date of this amendment or any refundings thereof which are secured by
any portion of such revenues derived form the licensing of motor vehicles.

(2)  No funds anticipated to be distributed annually among the several counties under the formula
state in Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this Constitution, as amended, as the same
existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment shall be pledges as security for
any obligations hereafter issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously
issued pledging such funds may be refunded at a lower net average interest cost rate by the
issuance of refunding bonds maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the same
revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (13) of this subsection (d).

(3) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) beginning July 1, 1973 and

collected, be placed monthly in the school district and junior college district capital outlay and
debt service fund in the state treasury and used only as provided in this amendment. Such revenue
shall be distributed annually among the several school districts and junior college districts in the
ratio of the number of instruction units in each school district or junior college district in each year
computed as provided herein. The amount of the first revenues derived from the state motor
vehicle license taxes to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided therein shall bean
amount equal in the aggregate to the product of six hundred dollars ($600) multiplied by the total
number of instruction units in all school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, plus
an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of eight hundred dollars ($800) multiplied by the
total number of instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year
1972-73 and for each school fiscal year thereafter which is in excess of the total number of such
instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, such
excess units being designated "growth units." The amount of the first revenues derived from the
state motor vehicle license taxes to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein
shall additionally be an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of four hundred dollars
($400) multiplied by the total number of instruction units in all junior college districts of Florida.
The number of instruction units in each school district or junior college district in each year for
the purposes of this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the number of instruction units in each
school district for the school fiscal year 1967-68 or junior college district for the school fiscal year
1968-69 computed in the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the number of
instruction units in such school district, including growth units, or junior college district for the
school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and
approved by the state board of education (hereinafter called the state board), or (3) the number of
instruction units in each school district, including growth units, or junior college district on behalf
of which the state board has issued bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates under this
amendment which will produce sufficient revenues under this amendment to equal one and
twelve-hundredths (1.12) times the aggregate amount of principal of an interest on all bonds or
motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued under this amendment which will mature and
become due in such year, computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law
and approved by the state board.

(4) Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as now created and
constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the State Constitution as revised in 1968, or by such
other instrumentality of the state which shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and
functions of the state board, including the powers, duties and functions of the state board
provided in this amendment. For the purposes of this amendment, said state board shall be a body
corporate and shall have all the powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other
constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this amendment heretofore or
hereafter conferred upon said state board.

management, control and supervision of the proceeds of the first part of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles provided for in this subsection
(d). The state board shall also have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds for the use of any
school board of any school district or board of trustees of any junior college district in acquiring,
building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing, equipping,
maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects for school purposes to issue bonds
or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates theretofore issued by said state board.  All such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates shall bear interest at not exceeding five per centum per annum, or such
higher interest rate as may be, authorized by statute heretofore or hereafter passed by a three-
fifths (3/5) vote of each house of the legislature. All such bonds shall mature serially in annual
installments commencing not more than three (3) years from the date of issuance thereof and
ending. not later than thirty (30) years from the date of issuance, or July 1, 2007, A. D.,
whichever is earlier. All such motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall mature prior to July
1, 2007 A. D. The state board shall have power to determine all other details of said bonds or
motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates and to sell at public sale after public advertisement, or
exchange said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, upon such terms and conditions
as the state board shall provide.

(6) The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and
interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, including refunding bonds or

into any covenants and other agreements with the holder of such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates at the time of the issuance thereof concerning the security thereof and the
rights of the holders thereof, all of which covenants and agreements shall constitute legally
binding and irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable by such holders
in any court of competent jurisdiction.

board until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the issuance thereof by the school board
of the school district or board of trustees of the junior college district on behalf of which the
obligations are to be issued. The state board of education shall limit the amount of such bonds or
motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which can be issued on behalf of any school district or
junior college district to ninety percent (90%) of the amount which it determines can be serviced
by the revenue accruing to the school district or junior college district under the provisions of this
amendment, and such determination shall be conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates shall be issued in the name of the state board of education but shall be
issued for and on behalf of the school board of the school district or board of trustees of the junior
college district requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of qualified electors
shall be required for the issuance thereof.

equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects in such school districts
or junior college districts in which capital outlay projects have been approved by the school board
of the school district or board of trustees of the junior college district, pursuant to the most recent
survey or surveys conducted under regulations prescribed by the state board to determine the
capital outlay needs of the school district or junior college district. The state board shall have

as amended, but this provision shall not be construed to prevent the refunding of any such
outstanding bonds or obligations pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (a)(2).

and for fifty years thereafter, all of the proceeds of the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes collected from every person, including municipalities, as provided and levied as of the time
of adoption of this subsection (a)(2) in chapter 203, Florida Statutes (hereinafter called "gross
receipts taxes"), shall, as collected, be placed in a trust fund to be known as the "public education

derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of
the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount
which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination
shall be conclusive.

monthly in the state roads distribution fund in the state treasury.

(2) Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this reference
as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the "second gas tax" as
referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the formula
stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders
of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof secured by
any portion of the "second gas tax."

(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in Article IX, Section 16, of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter issued
or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging revenues
allocated under said Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded at a lower average net interest cost
rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured
by the same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available federal
census, and one-half in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales or use in
each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal year. If the
annual debt service requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including any
deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount
which would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts
allocated to other counties shall be reduced proportionately.

(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by the
state board of administration created under said Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of

construction of roads in a county when approved by the governing body of the county and the
state agency supervising the state road system; and (iii) to refund obligations secured by any
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued
unless a state fiscal agency created by law has made a determination that in no state fiscal year
will the debt service requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion
of the "second gas tax" allocated to the county exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the
pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding state fiscal year, and of the
annual average net tolls anticipated during the first five years of operation of new projects to be
financed.  Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be payable primarily from the pledged
tolls, the pledged portions of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county.

amendment as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of providing
that after the effective date of this amendment the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the
licensing of motor vehicles as referred to therein shall be distributed annually among the several
counties in the ratio of the number of instruction units in each county, the same being coterminus

whose conduct, during term of office or otherwise occurring on or after November 1, 1966,
(without regard to the effective date of this section) demonstrates a present unfitness to hold
office, and to investigate and recommend the reprimand of a justice or judge whose conduct,
during term of office or otherwise occurring on or after November 1, 1966 (without regard to the
effective date of this section), warrants such a reprimand. The commission shall be composed of:
(1) Two judges of district courts of appeal selected by the judges of those courts, two circuit
judges selected by the judges of the circuit courts and two judges of county courts selected by the
judges of those courts;
(2) Two electors who reside in the state, who are members of the bar of Florida, and who shall
be chosen by the governing body of the bar of Florida; and
(3) Five electors who reside in the state, who have never held judicial office or been members of
the bar of Florida, and who shall be appointed by the governor.

(b) The members of the judicial qualifications commission shall serve staggered terms, not to
exceed six years, as prescribed by general law. No member of the commission except a justice or
judge shall be eligible for state judicial office so long as he is a member of the commission and for
a period of two years thereafter.  No member of the commission shall hold office in a political
party or participate in any campaign for judicial office or hold public office; provided that a judge
may participate in his own campaign for judicial office and hold that office.  The commission shall
elect one of its members as its chairman.

(c) Members of the judicial qualifications commission not subject to impeachment shall be subject
to removal from the commission pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, Section 7, Florida
Constitution.

(d) The commission shall adopt rules regulating its proceedings, the filling of vacancies by the

disqualified or incapacitated members. The commission's rules, or any part thereof, may be
repealed by general law enacted by a majority vote of the membership of each house of the
legislature, or by the supreme court, five justices concurring. Until formal charges against a justice
or judge are filed by the commission with the clerk of the supreme court of Florida all proceedings

commission may with seven members concurring recommend to the supreme court the temporary
suspension of any justice or judge against whom formal charges are pending.

(e) The commission shall have access to all information from all executive, legislative and judicial

all information in the possession of the commission for use in consideration of impeachment or
suspension, respectively. 

(f) Upon recommendation of two-thirds of the members of the judicial qualifications commission,
the supreme court may order that the justice or judge be disciplined by appropriate reprimand, or
be removed from office with termination of compensation for willful or persistent failure to
perform his duties or for other conduct unbecoming a member of the judiciary demonstrating a
present unfitness to hold office, or be involuntarily retired for any permanent disability that
seriously interferes with the performance of his duties. Malafides, scienter or moral turpitude on
the part of a justice or judge shall not be required for removal from office of a justice or judge
whose conduct demonstrates a present unfitness to hold office. After the filing of a formal
proceeding and upon request of the commission, the supreme court may suspend the justice or
judge from office, with or without compensation, pending final determination of the inquiry.

(g) The power of removal conferred by this section shall be both alternative and cumulative to the
power of impeachment and to the power of suspension by the governor and removal by the

subject of proceedings by the judicial qualifications commission is a justice of the supreme court
of Florida all justices of such court automatically shall be disqualified to sit as justices of such
court with respect to all proceedings therein concerning such person and the supreme court for
such purposes shall be composed of a panel consisting of the seven chief judges of the judicial
circuits of the state of Florida most senior in tenure of judicial office as circuit judge.  For
purposes of determining seniority of such circuit judges in the event there be judges of equal
tenure in judicial office as circuit judge the judge or judges from the lower numbered circuit or
circuits shall be deemed senior.  In the event any such chief circuit judge is under investigation by
the judicial qualifications commission or is otherwise disqualified or unable to serve on the panel,
the next most senior chief circuit judge or judges shall serve in place of such disqualified or
disabled chief circuit judge.

(2) That portion of Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (a) of this Constitution, as amended, which
by reference adopted Article XII, Section 19 of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, as the same
existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as
part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this amendment all of the proceeds of the revenues
derived from the gross receipts taxes, as therein defined, collected in each year shall be applied as
provided therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of
holders of bonds or certificates issued before the effective date of this amendment or any
refundings thereof which are secured by such gross receipts taxes. No bonds or other obligations
may be issued pursuant to the provisions of Article XII, Section 19, of the Constitution of 1885,
as amended, but this provision shall not be construed to prevent the refunding of any such
outstanding bonds or obligations pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (a)(2).
Subject to the requirements of the first paragraph of this subsection (a)(2), beginning July 1, 1975,
and for fifty years thereafter, all of the proceeds of the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes collected from every person, including municipalities, as provided and levied as of the time
of adoption of this subsection (a)(2) in chapter 203, Florida Statutes (hereinafter called "gross
receipts taxes"), shall, as collected, be placed in a trust fund to be known as the "public education
capital outlay and debt service trust fund" in the state treasury (hereinafter referred to as "capital
outlay fund"), and used only as provided herein.
The capital outlay funds shall be administered by the state board of education as created and
constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the Constitution of Florida as revised in 1968.
(hereinafter referred to as "state board"), or by such other instrumentality of the state which shall
hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and functions of the state board, including the
powers, duties and functions of the state board provided in this subsection (a)(2). The state board
shall be a body corporate and shall have all the powers provided herein in addition to all other
constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this subsection (a)(2) heretofore or
hereafter conferred by law upon the state board, or its predecessor created by the Constitution of
1885, as amended.
State bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state maybe issued, without a
vote of the electors, by the state board pursuant to law to finance or refinance capital projects
theretofore authorized by the legislature, and any purposes appurtenant or incidental thereto, for
the state system of public education provided for in Section 1 of Article IX of this Constitution
(hereinafter referred to as "state system"), including but not limited to institutions of higher
learning, junior colleges, vocational technical schools, or public schools, as now defined or as may
hereafter be defined by law. All such bonds shall mature not later than July 1, 2025. All other
details of such bonds shall be as provided by law or by the proceedings authorizing such bonds;
provided, however, that no bonds, except refunding bonds, shall be issued, and no proceeds shall
be expended for the cost of
any capital project, unless such project has been authorized by the legislature.
Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (a)(2) shall be primarily payable from such revenues
derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of
the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount
which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination
shall be conclusive.
The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used only for the following,
purposes and in the following order of priority:
    a. For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds maturing in such fiscal year;
b. For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the proceedings authorizing the
issuance of bonds of any amounts required to be deposited in such reserve funds in such fiscal
year;
c. For direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of any capital project for the state
system theretofore authorized by the legislature, or for the purchase or redemption of outstanding
bonds in accordance with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized the issuance of such
bonds.

(b)  REFUNDING BONDS.  Revenue bonds to finance the cost of state capital projects issued
prior to the date this revision becomes effective, including projects of the Florida state turnpike
authority or its successor but excluding all portions of the state highway system, may be refunded
as provided by law without vote of the electors at a lower net average interest cost rate by the
issuance of bonds maturing not later than the obligations, refunded, secured by the same revenues
only.

(c)  MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES.

(1) A state tax, designated "second gas tax," of two cents per gallon upon gasoline and other like
products, of petroleum. and an equivalent tax upon other sources of energy used to propel motor
vehicles as levied by Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is hereby
continued. The proceeds of said tax shall be placed monthly in the state roads distribution fund in
the state treasury.

(2) Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this reference
as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the "second gas tax" as
referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the formula
stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders
of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof secured by
any portion of the "second gas tax."

(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in Article IX, Section 16, of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter issued
or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging revenues
allocated under said Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded at a lower average net interest cost
rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured
by the same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and after payment of
administrative expenses, the "second gas tax" shall be allocated to the account of each of the
several counties in the amounts to be determined as follows: There shall be an initial allocation of
one-fourth in the ratio of county area to state area, one-fourth in the ratio of the total county
population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available federal
census, and one-half in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales or use in
each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal year. If the
annual debt service requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including any
deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount
which would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts
allocated to other counties shall be reduced proportionately.

(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by the
state board of administration created under said Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of
1885, as amended, and which is continued as a body corporate for the life of this subsection 9(c).
The board shall remit the proceeds of the "second gas tax" in each county account for use in said
county as follows: eighty per cent to the state agency supervising the state road system and
twenty per cent to the governing body of the county. The percentage allocated to the county may
be increased by general law. The proceeds of the "second gas tax" subject to allocation to the
several counties under this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of obligations
pledging revenues allocated pursuant to Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as
amended, and any refundings thereof; second, for the payment of debt service on bonds issued as
provided by this paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as defined by
law; and third, for the acquisition and construction of roads and for road maintenance as
authorized by law. When authorized by law, state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the
state may be issued without any election: (i ) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the
"second gas tax" allocated to a county under Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885,
as amended; (ii) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads in a county when approved
by the governing body of the county and the state agency supervising the state road system; and
(iii) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax" allocated under
paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued unless a state fiscal agency created by law has
made a determination that in no state fiscal year will the debt service requirements of the bonds
and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to the county
exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that
county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected
in the preceding state fiscal year, and of the annual average net tolls anticipated during the first
five state fiscal years of operation of new projects to be financed, and of any other legally
available pledged revenues collected in the preceding state fiscal year. Bonds issued pursuant to
this subsection shall be payable primarily from the pledged tolls, the pledged portions of the
"second gas tax" allocated to that county, and any other pledged revenue, and shall mature not
later than forty years from the date of issuance.

(d) SCHOOL BONDS

(1) Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this constitution, as amended, (which, by reference,
adopted Article XII, Section 18, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended) as the same existed
immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as part of this
amendment as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of providing
that after the effective date of this amendment the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the
licensing of motor vehicles as referred to therein shall be distributed annually among the several
counties in the ratio of the number of instruction units in each county, the same being coterminus
with the school district of each county as provided in Article IX, Section 4, Subsection (a) of this
constitution, in each year computed as provided therein to the extent necessary to comply with all
obligations to or for the benefit of holders of bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates
issued before the effective date of this amendment or any refundings thereof which are secured by
any portion of such revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles.

(2) No funds anticipated to be distributed annually among the several counties under the formula
stated in Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this constitution, as amended, as the same
existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment shall be pledged as security for
any obligations hereafter issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously
issued pledging such funds may be refunded at a lower net average interest cost rate by the
issuance of refunding bonds maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the same
revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (13) of this subsection (d).

(3) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) beginning July 1, 1973 and

collected, be placed monthly in the school district and junior college district capital outlay and
debt service fund in the state treasury and used only as provided in this amendment. Such revenue
shall be distributed annually among the several school districts and junior college districts in the
ratio of the number of instruction units in each school district or junior college district in each year
computed as provided herein. The amount of the first revenues derived from the state motor
vehicle license taxes to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided therein shall bean
amount equal in the aggregate to the product of six hundred dollars ($600) multiplied by the total
number of instruction units in all school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, plus
an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of eight hundred dollars ($800) multiplied by the
total number of instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year

instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, such
excess units being designated "growth units." The amount of the first revenues derived from the
state motor vehicle license taxes to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein

the purposes of this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the number of instruction units in each
school district for the school fiscal year 1967-68 or junior college district for the school fiscal year
1968-69 computed in the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the number of
instruction units in such school district, including growth units, or junior college district for the
school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and

twelve-hundredths (1.12) times the aggregate amount of principal of an interest on all bonds or
motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued under this amendment which will mature and
become due in such year, computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law
and approved by the state board.

(4) Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as now created and
constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the State Constitution as revised in 1968, or by such
other instrumentality of the state which shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and
functions of the state board, including the powers, duties and functions of the state board
provided in this amendment. For the purposes of this amendment, said state board shall be a body
corporate and shall have all the powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other

or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates theretofore issued by said state board.  All such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates shall bear interest at not exceeding five per centum per annum, or such
higher interest rate as may be, authorized by statute heretofore or hereafter passed by a three-
fifths (3/5) vote of each house of the legislature. All such bonds shall mature serially in annual

motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which can be issued on behalf of any school district or
junior college district to ninety percent (90%) of the amount which it determines can be serviced

amendment, and such determination shall be conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates shall be issued in the name of the state board of education but shall be
issued for and on behalf of the school board of the school district or board of trustees of the junior
college district requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of qualified electors

part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, except revenue bonds,
revenue certificates or other evidences of indebtedness hereafter issued thereunder may be issued
by the agency of the state so authorized by law.

(2) That portion of Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (a) of this Constitution, as amended, which
by reference adopted Article XII, Section 19 of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, as the same
existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as
part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of

derived from the gross receipts taxes, as therein defined, collected in each year shall be applied as
provided therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of
holders of bonds or certificates issued before the effective date of this amendment or any
refundings thereof which are secured by such gross receipts taxes. No bonds or other obligations

as amended, but this provision shall not be construed to prevent the refunding of any such
outstanding bonds or obligations pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (a)(2).

derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of
the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount
which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination
shall be conclusive.
The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used only for the following,
purposes and in the following order of priority:
    a. For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds maturing in such fiscal year;

prior to the date this revision becomes effective, including projects of the Florida state turnpike
authority or its successor but excluding all portions of the state highway system, may be refunded

continued. The proceeds of said tax shall be placed monthly in the state roads distribution fund in
the state treasury.

(2) Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this reference
as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the "second gas tax" as
referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the formula
stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders
of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof secured by
any portion of the "second gas tax."

(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in Article IX, Section 16, of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter issued

population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available federal
census, and one-half in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales or use in
each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal year. If the
annual debt service requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including any
deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount
which would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts
allocated to other counties shall be reduced proportionately.

(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by the
state board of administration created under said Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of
1885, as amended, and which is continued as a body corporate for the life of this subsection 9(c).
The board shall remit the proceeds of the "second gas tax" in each county account for use in said
county as follows: eighty per cent to the state agency supervising the state road system and
twenty per cent to the governing body of the county. The percentage allocated to the county may

several counties under this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of obligations
pledging revenues allocated pursuant to Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as
amended, and any refundings thereof; second, for the payment of debt service on bonds issued as
provided by this paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as defined by

as amended; (ii) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads in a county when approved
by the governing body of the county and the state agency supervising the state road system; and
(iii) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax" allocated under
paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued unless a state fiscal agency created by law has
made a determination that in no state fiscal year will the debt service requirements of the bonds
and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to the county
exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that
county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected
in the preceding state fiscal year, and of the annual average net tolls anticipated during the first
five state fiscal years of operation of new projects to be financed, and of any other legally

"second gas tax" allocated to that county, and any other pledged revenue, and shall mature not
later than forty years from the date of issuance.

SECTION 18.  Laws requiring counties or municipalities to spend funds or limiting their ability
to raise revenue or receive state tax revenue.

(a)  No county or municipality shall be bound by any general law requiring such county or
municipality to spend funds or to take an action requiring the expenditure of funds unless the
legislature has determined that such law fulfills an important state interest and unless: funds have
been appropriated that have been estimated at the time of enactment to be sufficient to fund such
expenditure; the legislature authorizes or has authorized a county or municipality to enact a
funding source not available for such county or municipality on February 1, 1989, that can be
used to generate the amount of funds estimated to be sufficient to fund such expenditure by a
simple majority vote of the governing body of such county or municipality; the law requiring such
expenditure is approved by two-thirds of the membership in each house of the legislature; the
expenditure is required to comply with a law that applies to all persons similarly situated,
including the state and local governments; or the law is either required to comply with a federal
requirement or required for eligibility for a federal entitlement, which federal requirement
specifically contemplates actions by counties or municipalities for compliance.

(b)  Except upon approval of each house of the legislature by two-thirds of the membership, the
legislature may not enact, amend, or repeal any general law if the anticipated effect of doing so
would be to reduce the authority that municipalities or counties have to raise revenues in the
aggregate, as such authority exists on February 1, 1989.

(c)  Except upon approval of each house of the legislature by two-thirds of the membership, the

aggregate on February 1, 1989. The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to enhancements enacted after February 1, 1989, to state tax sources,
or during a fiscal emergency declared in a written joint proclamation issued by the president of the
senate and the speaker of the house of representatives, or where the legislature provides
additional state-shared revenues which are anticipated to be sufficient to replace the anticipated
aggregate loss of state-shared revenues resulting from the reduction of the percentage of the state
tax shared with counties and municipalities, which source of replacement revenues shall be subject
to the same requirements for repeal or modification as provided herein for a state-shared tax
source existing on February 1, 1989.

legislative branch. Laws enacted pursuant to this subsection shall contain only exemptions from
the requirements of subsections (a) or (b) and provisions governing the enforcement of this
section, and shall relate to one subject.

remain in force, and such laws apply to records of the legislative and judicial branches, until they

capital project, unless such project has been authorized by the legislature.

     Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (a)(2) shall be primarily payable from such revenues
derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of
the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount
which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination
shall be conclusive.

     The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used only for the following
purposes and in the following order of priority:

     a.  For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds due in such fiscal year;

     b.  For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the proceedings authorizing the
issuance of bonds of any amounts required to be deposited in such reserve funds in such fiscal
year;

     c.  For direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of any capital project for the state
system theretofore authorized by the legislature, or for the purchase or redemption of outstanding
bonds in accordance with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized the issuance of such
bonds, or for the purpose of maintaining, restoring, or repairing existing public educational
facilities.

(b)  REFUNDING BONDS.  Revenue bonds to finance the cost of state capital projects issued
prior to the date this revision becomes effective, including projects of the Florida state turnpike
authority or its successor but excluding all portions of the state highway system, may be refunded
as provided by law without vote of the electors at a lower net average interest cost rate by the
issuance of bonds maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the same revenues
only.

(c)  MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES.

     (1)  A state tax, designated "second gas tax," of two cents per gallon upon gasoline and other
like products of petroleum and an equivalent tax upon other sources of energy used to propel
motor vehicles as levied by Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is
hereby continued. The proceeds of said tax shall be placed monthly in the state roads distribution
fund in the state treasury.

     (2)  Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this
reference as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the
purpose of providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the "second gas
tax" as referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the
formula stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit
of holders of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof
secured by any portion of the "second gas tax."

     (3)  No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in Article IX, Section 16, of
the Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter
issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging
revenues allocated under said Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded at a lower average net
interest cost rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations
refunded, secured by the same revenues and
any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

     (4)  Subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and after payment of
administrative expenses, the "second gas tax" shall be allocated to the account of each of the
several counties in the amounts to be determined as follows: There shall be an initial allocation of
one-fourth in the ratio of county area to state area, one-fourth in the ratio of the total county
population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available federal
census, and one-half in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales or use in
each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal year. If the
annual debt service requirements of any
obligations issued for any county, including any deficiencies for prior years, secured under
paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount which would be allocated to that county
under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts allocated to other counties shall be
reduced proportionately.

     (5)  Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by
the state board of administration created under said Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of
1885, as amended, and which is continued as a body corporate for the life of this subsection 9(c).
The board shall remit the proceeds of the "second gas tax" in each county account for use in said
county as follows: eighty per cent to the state agency supervising the state road system and
twenty per cent to the governing body of the county. The percentage allocated to the county may
be increased by general law. The proceeds of the "second gas tax" subject to allocation to the
several counties under this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of obligations
pledging revenues allocated pursuant to Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as
amended, and
any refundings thereof; second, for the payment of debt service on bonds issued as provided by
this paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as defined by law; and
third, for the acquisition and construction of roads and for road maintenance as authorized by law.
When authorized by law, state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be issued
without any election: (i) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax"
allocated to a county under Article
IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended; (ii) to finance the acquisition and
construction of roads in a county when approved by the governing body of the county and the
state agency supervising the state road system; and (iii) to refund obligations secured by any
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued
unless a state fiscal agency created by law has made a determination that in no state fiscal year
will the debt service requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion
of the "second gas tax" allocated to the county exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged
portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the
pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding state fiscal year, and of the
annual average net tolls anticipated during the first five state fiscal years of operation of new
projects to be financed, and of any other legally available pledged revenues collected in the
preceding state fiscal year. Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be payable primarily
from the pledged tolls, the pledged portions of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county, and
any other pledged revenue, and shall mature not later than forty years from the date of issuance.

(d)  SCHOOL BONDS.

     (1)  Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this constitution, as amended, (which, by
reference, adopted Article XII, Section 18, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended) as the same
existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as
part of this amendment as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, for the purpose of
providing that after the effective date of this amendment
the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles as referred to
therein shall be distributed annually among the several counties in the ratio of the number of
instruction units in each county, the same being coterminus with the school district of each
countyas provided in Article IX, Section 4, Subsection (a) of this constitution, in each year
computed as provided therein to the extent necessary to comply
with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders of bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates issued before the effective date of this amendment or any refundings thereof which are
secured by any portion of such revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles.

     (2)  No funds anticipated to be distributed annually among the several counties under the
formula stated in Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this constitution, as amended, as the
same existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment shall be pledged as security
for any obligations hereafter issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations
previously issued pledging such funds may be refunded by the issuance of refunding bonds.

     (3)  Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) beginning July 1, 1973,
the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles (hereinafter called
"motor vehicle license revenues") to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this
amendment, shall, as collected, be placed monthly in the school district and community college
district capital outlay and debt service fund in the state treasury and used only as provided in this
amendment. Such revenue shall be distributed annually among the several school districts and
community college districts in the ratio of the number of instruction units in each school district or
community college district in each year computed as provided herein. The amount of the first
motor vehicle license revenues to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein
shall be an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of six hundred dollars ($600) multiplied
by the total number of instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal
year 1967-68, plus an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of eight hundred dollars
($800) multiplied by the total number of instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for
the school fiscal year 1972-73 and for each school fiscal year thereafter which is in excess of the
total number of such instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year
1967-68, such excess units being designated "growth units." The amount of the first motor vehicle
license revenues to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein shall
additionally be an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of four hundred dollars ($400)
multiplied by the total number of instruction units in all community college districts of Florida.
The number of instruction units in each school district or community college district in each year
for the purposes of this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the number of instruction units in
each school district for the school fiscal year 1967-68 or community college district for the school
fiscal year 1968-69 computed in the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the
number of instruction units in such school district, including growth units, or community college
district for the school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by
general law and approved by the state board of education (hereinafter called the state board), or
(3) the number of instruction units in each school district, including growth units, or community
college district on behalf of which the state board has issued bonds or motor vehicle license
revenue anticipation certificates under this amendment which will produce sufficient revenues
under this amendment to equal one and twelve-hundredths (1.12) times the aggregate amount of
principal of and interest on all bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
issued under this amendment which will mature and become due in such year, computed in the
manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by the state board.

     (4)  Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as now created and
constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the State Constitution as revised in 1968, or by such
other instrumentality of the state which shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and
functions of the state board, including the powers, duties and functions of the state board
provided in this amendment. For the purposes of this amendment, said state board shall be a body
corporate and shall have all the powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other
constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this amendment heretofore or
hereafter conferred upon said state board.

     (5)  The state board shall, in addition to its other constitutional and statutory powers, have the
management, control and supervision of the proceeds of the first motor vehicle license revenues
provided for in this subsection (d). The state board shall also have power, for the purpose of
obtaining funds for the use of any school board of any school district or board of trustees of any
community college district in acquiring, building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving,
enlarging, furnishing, equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects
for school purposes to issue bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, and
also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates to pay, fund or
refund any bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates theretofore issued by
said state board. All such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates shall
bear interest at not exceeding the rate provided by general law and shall mature not later than
thirty years after the date of issuance thereof. The state board shall have power to determine all
other details of the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates and to sell in
the manner provided by general law, or exchange the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates, upon such terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.

     (6)  The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and
interest on such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, including
refunding bonds or refunding motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, all or any
part from the motor vehicle license revenues provided for in this amendment and to enter into any
covenants and other agreements with the holders of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates at the time of the issuance thereof concerning the security thereof and the
rights of the holders thereof, all of which covenants and agreements shall constitute legally
binding and irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable by such holders
in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

     (7)  No such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates shall ever be
issued by the state board, except to refund outstanding bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates, until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the
issuance thereof by the school board of the school district or board of trustees of the community
college district on behalf of which the obligations are to be issued. The state board of education
shall limit the amount of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
which can be issued on behalf of any school district or community college district to ninety
percent (90%) of the amount which it determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to the
school district or community college district under the provisions of this amendment, and shall
determine the reasonable allocation of the interest savings from the issuance of refunding bonds or
motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, and such determinations shall be
conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates shall be
issued in the name of the state board of education but shall be issued for and on behalf of the
school board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college district
requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of qualified electors shall be required
for the issuance thereof.

     (8)  The state board shall in each year use the funds distributable pursuant to this amendment
to the credit of each school district or community college district only in the following manner and
in order of priority:

     a.  To comply with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d).

     b.  To pay all amounts of principal and interest due in such year on any bonds or motor vehicle
license revenue anticipation certificates issued under the authority hereof, including refunding
bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, issued on behalf of the school
board of such school district or board of trustees of such community college district; subject,
however, to any covenants or agreements made by the state board concerning the rights between
holders of different issues of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates,
as herein authorized.

     c.  To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future requirements for debt
service or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
issued on behalf of the school board of such school district or board of trustees of such
community college district under the authority hereof, whenever the state board shall deem it
necessary or advisable, and in such amounts and under such terms and conditions as the state
board shall in its discretion determine.

     d.  To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school districts or the boards of
trustees of the community college districts for use in payment of debt service on bonds heretofore
or hereafter issued by any such school boards of the school districts or boards of trustees of the
community college districts where the proceeds of the bonds were used, or are to be used, in the
acquiring, building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing,
equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects in such school districts
or community college districts and which capital outlay projects have been approved by the school
board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college district, pursuant to the
most recent survey or surveys conducted under regulations prescribed by the state board to
determine the capital outlay needs of the school district or community college district. The state
board shall have power at the time of issuance of any bonds by any school board of any school
district or board of trustees of any community college district to covenant and agree with such
school board or board of trustees as to the rank and priority of payments to be made for different
issues of bonds under this subparagraph d., and may further agree that any amounts to be
distributed under this subparagraph d. may be pledged for the debt service on bonds issued by any
school board of any school district or board of trustees of any community college district and for
the rank and priority of such pledge. Any such covenants or agreements of the state board may be
enforced by any holders of such bonds in any court of competent jurisdiction.

     e.  To pay the expenses of the state board in administering this subsection (d), which shall be
prorated among the various school districts and community college districts and paid out of the
proceeds of the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates or from the funds
distributable to each school district and community college district on the same basis as such
motor vehicle license revenues are distributable to the various school districts and community
college districts.

     f.  To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school districts or boards of
trustees of the community college districts for the payment of the cost of acquiring, building,
constructing, altering, remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing, equipping, maintaining,
renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects for school purposes in
such school district or community college district as shall be requested by resolution of the school
board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college district.

     g.  When all major capital outlay needs of a school district or community college district have
been met as determined by the state board, on the basis of a survey made pursuant to regulations
of the state board and approved by the state board, all such funds remaining shall be distributed
annually and used for such school purposes in such school
district or community college district as the school board of the school district or board of
trustees of the community college district shall determine, or as may be provided by general law.

     (9)  Capital outlay projects of a school district or community college district shall be eligible to
participate in the funds accruing under this amendment and derived from the proceeds of bonds
and motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates and from the motor vehicle license
revenues, only in the order of priority of needs, as shown by a survey or surveys conducted in the
school district or community college district under regulations prescribed by the state board, to
determine the capital outlay needs of the school district or community college district and
approved by the state board; provided that the priority of such projects may be changed from time
to time upon the request of the school board of the school district or board of trustees of the
community college district and with the approval of the state board; and provided, further, that
this paragraph (9) shall not in any manner affect any covenant, agreement or pledge made by the
state board in the issuance by said state board of any bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates, or in connection with the issuance of any bonds of any school board of
any school district or board of trustees of any community college district.

     (10)  The state board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary
to the full exercise of the powers herein granted and no legislation shall be required to render this
amendment of full force and operating effect. The legislature shall not reduce the levies of said
motor vehicle license revenues during the life of this amendment to any degree which will fail to
provide the full amount necessary to comply with the provisions of this amendment and pay the
necessary expenses of administering the laws relating to the licensing of motor vehicles, and shall
not enact any law having the effect of withdrawing the proceeds of such motor vehicle license
revenues from the operation of this amendment and shall not enact any law impairing or materially
altering the rights of the holders of any bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates issued pursuant to this amendment or impairing or altering any covenant or agreement
of the state board, as provided in such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates.

     (11)  Bonds issued by the state board pursuant to this subsection (d) shall be payable primarily
from said motor vehicle license revenues as provided herein, and if heretofore or hereafter
authorized by law, may be additionally secured by pledging the full faith and credit of the state
without an election. When heretofore or hereafter authorized by law, bonds issued pursuant to
Article XII, Section 18 of the Constitution of 1885, as amended prior to 1968, and bonds issued
pursuant to Article XII, Section 9, subsection (d) of the Constitution as revised in 1968, and
bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (d), may be refunded by the issuance of bonds
additionally secured by the full faith and credit of the state.

(e)  DEBT LIMITATION.  Bonds issued pursuant to this Section 9 of Article XII which are
payable primarily from revenues pledged pursuant to this section shall not be included in applying
the limits upon the amount of state bonds contained in Section 11, Article VII, of this revision.

SECTION 1.  Taxation; appropriations; state expenses; state revenue limitation.

(a)  No tax shall be levied except in pursuance of law. No state ad valorem taxes shall be levied
upon real estate or tangible personal property. All other forms of taxation shall be preempted to
the state except as provided by general law.

(b)  Motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, trailers, trailer coaches and mobile homes, as defined by law,

(d)  Provision shall be made by law for raising sufficient revenue to defray the expenses of the
state for each fiscal period.

(e)  Except as provided herein, state revenues collected for any fiscal year shall be limited to state
revenues allowed under this subsection for the prior fiscal year plus an adjustment for growth. As
used in this subsection, "growth" means an amount equal to the average annual rate of growth in
Florida personal income over the most recent twenty quarters times the state revenues allowed
under this subsection for the prior fiscal year. For the 1995-1996 fiscal year, the state revenues
allowed under this subsection for the prior fiscal year shall equal the state revenues collected for
the 1994-1995 fiscal year. Florida personal income shall be determined by the legislature, from
information available from the United States Department of Commerce or its successor on the
first day of February prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. State revenues collected for any
fiscal year in excess of this limitation shall be transferred to the budget stabilization fund until the
fund reaches the maximum balance specified in Section 19(g) of Article III, and thereafter shall be
refunded to taxpayers as provided by general law. State revenues allowed under this subsection
for any fiscal year may be increased by a two-thirds vote of the membership of each house of the
legislature in a separate bill that contains no other subject and that sets forth the dollar amount by
which the state revenues allowed will be increased. The vote may not be taken less than
seventy-two hours after the third reading of the bill. For purposes of this  subsection, "state
revenues" means taxes, fees, licenses, and charges for services imposed by the legislature on
individuals, businesses, or agencies outside state government. However, "state revenues" does not
include: revenues that are necessary to meet the requirements set forth in documents authorizing
the issuance of bonds by the state; revenues that are used to provide matching funds for the
federal Medicaid program with the exception of the revenues used to support the Public Medical
Assistance Trust Fund or its successor program and with the exception of state matching funds
used to fund elective expansions made after July 1, 1994; proceeds from the state lottery returned
as prizes; receipts of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund; balances carried forward from prior
fiscal years; taxes, licenses, fees, and charges for services imposed by local, regional, or school
district governing bodies; or revenue from taxes, licenses, fees, and charges for services required
to be imposed by any amendment or revision to this constitution after July 1, 1994. An adjustment
to the revenue limitation shall be made by general law to reflect the fiscal impact of transfers of
responsibility for the funding of governmental functions between the state and other levels of
government. The legislature shall, by general law, prescribe procedures necessary to administer
this subsection.

Florida waters:

     (1)  No gill nets or other entangling nets shall be used in any Florida waters; and

     (2)  In addition to the prohibition set forth in (1), no other type of net containing more than

a gill net or an entangling net;

     (2)  "mesh area" of a net means the total area of netting with the meshes open to comprise the
maximum square footage. The square footage shall be calculated using standard mathematical
formulas for geometric shapes. Seines and other rectangular nets  shall be calculated using the
maximum length and maximum width of the netting. Trawls and other bag type nets shall be
calculated as a cone using the maximum circumference of the net mouth to derive the radius, and
the maximum length from the net mouth to the tail end of the net to derive the slant height.
Calculations for any other nets or combination type nets shall be based on the shapes of the
individual components;

to the laws of the United States of America;

     (4)  "Florida waters" means the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits

seaward of the coastline along the Gulf of Mexico and inside a line one mile seaward of the
coastline along the Atlantic Ocean.

purposes.

(e)  Persons violating this section shall be prosecuted and punished pursuant to the penalties

created.

     (1)  There shall be a judicial qualifications commission vested with jurisdiction to investigate
and recommend to the Supreme Court of Florida the removal from office of any justice or judge
whose conduct, during term of office or otherwise occurring on or after November 1, 1966,
(without regard to the effective date of this section)  demonstrates a present unfitness to hold
office, and to investigate and recommend the discipline of a justice or judge whose conduct,
during term of office or otherwise
occurring on or after November 1, 1966 (without regard to the effective date of this section),
warrants such discipline. For purposes of this section, discipline is defined as any or all of the
following: reprimand, fine, suspension with or without pay, or lawyer discipline. The commission

before or during service as a justice or judge if a
complaint is made no later than one year following service as a justice or judge. The commission
shall have jurisdiction regarding allegations of incapacity during service as a justice or judge. The
commission shall be composed of:

     a.  Two judges of district courts of appeal selected by the judges of those courts, two circuit
judges selected by the judges of the circuit courts and two judges of county courts selected by the
judges of those courts;

     b.  Four electors who reside in the state, who are members of the bar of Florida, and who shall
be chosen by the governing body of the bar of Florida; and

of the bar of Florida, and who shall be appointed by the governor.

     (2)  The members of the judicial qualifications commission shall serve staggered terms, not to
exceed six years, as prescribed by general law. No member of the commission except a judge shall
be eligible for state judicial office while acting as a member of the commission and for a period of

subject to removal from the commission pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, Section 7,
Florida Constitution.

     (4)  The commission shall adopt rules regulating its proceedings, the filling of vacancies by the
appointing authorities, the disqualification of members, the rotation of members between the
panels, and the temporary replacement of disqualified or incapacitated members. The
commission's rules, or any part thereof, may be repealed by general law enacted by a majority vote
of the membership of each house of the legislature, or by the supreme court, five justices
concurring. The commission shall have power to issue subpoenas. Until formal charges against a
justice or judge are filed by the investigative panel with the clerk of the supreme court of Florida

finding of probable cause and the filing by the investigative panel with said clerk of such formal
charges against a justice or judge such charges and all further proceedings before the
commission shall be public.

     (5)  The commission shall have access to all information from all executive, legislative and
judicial agencies, including grand juries, subject to the rules of the commission. At any time, on

available all information in the possession of the commission for use in consideration of
impeachment or suspension, respectively.

(b)  PANELS The commission shall be divided into an investigative panel and a hearing panel as
established by rule of the commission. The investigative panel is vested with the jurisdiction to
receive or initiate complaints, conduct investigations, dismiss complaints, and upon a vote of a
simple majority of the panel submit formal charges to the hearing panel. The hearing panel is
vested with the authority to receive and hear formal charges from the investigative panel and upon
a two-thirds vote of the panel recommend to the supreme court the removal of a justice or judge
or the involuntary retirement of a justice or judge for any permanent disability that seriously
interferes with the performance of judicial duties. Upon a simple majority vote of the membership
of the hearing panel, the panel may recommend to the supreme court that the justice or judge be
subject to appropriate discipline.

(c)  SUPREME COURT The supreme court shall receive recommendations from the judicial
qualifications commission's hearing panel. 

     (1)  The supreme court may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings,
conclusions, and recommendations of the commission and it may order that the justice or judge be
subjected to appropriate discipline, or be removed from office with termination of compensation
for willful or persistent failure to perform judicial duties or for other conduct unbecoming a
member of the judiciary demonstrating a present unfitness to hold office, or be involuntarily
retired for any permanent disability that seriously interferes with the performance of judicial
duties. Malafides, scienter or moral turpitude on the part of a justice or judge shall not be required
for removal from office of a justice or judge whose conduct demonstrates a present unfitness to
hold office. After the filing of a formal proceeding and upon request of the investigative panel, the
supreme court may suspend the justice or judge from office, with or without compensation,
pending final determination of the inquiry.

     (2)  The supreme court may award costs to the prevailing party.

     (d)  The power of removal conferred by this section shall be both alternative and cumulative to
the power of impeachment.

subject of proceedings by the judicial qualifications commission is a justice of the supreme court
of Florida all justices of such court automatically shall be disqualified to sit as justices of such
court with respect to all proceedings therein concerning such person and the supreme court for
such purposes shall be composed of a panel consisting of the seven chief judges of the judicial
circuits of the state of Florida most senior in tenure of judicial office as circuit judge. For
purposes of determining seniority of such circuit judges in the event there be judges of equal
tenure in judicial office as circuit judge the judge or judges from the lower numbered circuit or
circuits shall be deemed senior. In the event any such chief circuit judge is under investigation by
the judicial qualifications commission or is otherwise disqualified or unable to serve on the panel,
the next most senior chief circuit judge or judges shall serve in place of such disqualified or
disabled chief circuit judge.

     of the bar of Florida, and who shall be appointed by the governor.

two years thereafter. No member of the commission shall hold office in a political party or
participate in any campaign for judicial office or hold public office; provided that a judge may

of the membership of each house of the legislature, or by the supreme court, five justices
concurring. The commission shall have power to issue subpoenas. Until formal charges against a
justice or judge are filed by the investigative panel with the clerk of the supreme court of Florida

legislative and judicial agencies, including grand juries, subject to the rules of the commission. At

commission shall make available all information in the possession of the commission for use in
consideration of impeachment or suspension, respectively.

(b) PANELS. The commission shall be divided into an investigative panel and a hearing panel as
established by rule of the commission. The investigative panel is vested with the jurisdiction to
receive or initiate complaints, conduct investigations, dismiss complaints, and upon a vote of a
simple majority of the panel submit formal charges to the hearing panel. The hearing panel is
vested with the authority to receive and hear formal charges from the investigative panel and upon
a two-thirds vote of the panel recommend to the supreme court the removal of a justice or judge
or the involuntary retirement of a justice or judge for any permanent disability that seriously
interferes with the performance of judicial duties. Upon a simple majority vote of the membership
of the hearing panel, the panel may recommend to the supreme court that the justice or judge be
subject to appropriate discipline.

(c) SUPREME COURT. The supreme court shall receive recommendations from the judicial
qualifications commission's hearing panel. 

  (1) The supreme court may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings,
  conclusions, and recommendations of the commission and it may order that the justice or
  judge be subjected to appropriate discipline, or be removed from office with termination of
  compensation for willful or persistent failure to perform judicial duties or for other conduct
  unbecoming a member of the judiciary demonstrating a present unfitness to hold office, or be
  involuntarily retired for any permanent disability that seriously interferes with the performance
  of judicial duties. Malafides, scienter or moral turpitude on the part of a justice or judge shall
  not be required for removal from office of a justice or judge whose conduct demonstrates a
  present unfitness to hold office. After the filing of a formal proceeding and upon request of
  the investigative panel, the supreme court may suspend the justice or judge from office, with
  or without compensation, pending final determination of the inquiry.

of Florida all justices of such court automatically shall be disqualified to sit as justices of such
court with respect to all proceedings therein concerning such person and the supreme court for
such purposes shall be composed of a panel consisting of the seven chief judges of the judicial
circuits of the state of Florida most senior in tenure of judicial office as circuit judge. For
purposes of determining seniority of such circuit judges in the event there be judges of equal
tenure in judicial office as circuit judge the judge or judges from the lower numbered circuit or
circuits shall be deemed senior. In the event any such chief circuit judge is under investigation by
the judicial qualifications commission or is otherwise disqualified or unable to serve on the panel,

  part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, except revenue
  bonds, revenue certificates or other
  evidences of indebtedness hereafter issued thereunder may be issued by the agency of the state

  (2) That portion of Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (a) of this Constitution, as amended,
  which by reference adopted Article XII, Section 19 of the Constitution of 1885, as amended,
  as the same existed immediately before the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this

referred to as "state system"), including but not limited to institutions of higher learning,
community colleges, vocational technical schools, or public schools, as now defined or as may
hereafter be defined by law. All such bonds shall mature not later than thirty years after the date of

the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount
which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts
taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination
shall be conclusive.

The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used only for the following
purposes and in the following order of priority:

  reference as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for

  interest cost rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations
  refunded, secured by the same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5)

    and one-half in the ratio of the total "second gas tax" collected on retail sales
    or use in each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during
    the previous fiscal year. If the annual debt service requirements of any
    obligations issued for any county, including any deficiencies for prior years,
    secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount which
    would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph,

    payment of debt service on bonds issued as provided by this paragraph (5) to finance the
    acquisition and construction of roads as defined by law; and third, for the acquisition and
    construction of roads and for road maintenance as authorized by law. When authorized by
    law, state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be issued without any
    election:
       
       (i) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax"

       state road system; and

       (iii) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the "second gas tax" allocated
       under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued unless a state fiscal agency
       created by law has made a determination that in no state fiscal year will the debt service
       requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion of the
       "second gas tax" allocated to the county exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged
       portion of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county for the preceding state fiscal
       year, of the pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding state
       fiscal year, and of the annual average net tolls anticipated during the first five state
       fiscal years of operation of new projects to be financed, and of any other legally
       available pledged revenues collected in the preceding state fiscal year. Bonds issued
       pursuant to this subsection shall be payable primarily from the pledged tolls, the
       pledged portions of the "second gas tax" allocated to that county, and any other
       pledged revenue, and shall mature not later than forty years from the date of issuance.

  year thereafter which is in excess of the total number of such instruction units in all the school
  districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, such excess units being designated
  "growth units." The amount of the first motor vehicle license revenues to be so set aside in
  each year and distributed as provided herein shall additionally be an amount equal in the

  of principal of and interest on all bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
  certificates issued under this amendment which will mature and become due in such year,
  computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by the

  renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects for school purposes to issue bonds or motor
  vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle
  license revenue anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle
  license revenue anticipation certificates theretofore issued by said state board. All such bonds
  or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates shall bear interest at not exceeding the
  rate provided by general law and shall mature not later than thirty years after the date of
  issuance thereof. The state board shall have power to determine all other details of the bonds
  or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates and to sell in the manner provided by
  general law, or exchange the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates,
  upon such terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.

  (6) The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and
  interest on such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, including

  issued by the state board, except to refund outstanding bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
  anticipation certificates, until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the issuance thereof
  by the school board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college
  district on behalf of which the obligations are to be issued. The state board of education shall
  limit the amount of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates which
  can be issued on behalf of any school district or community college district to ninety percent
  (90%) of the amount which it determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to the

  determine the reasonable allocation of the interest savings from the issuance of refunding
  bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, and such determinations shall
  be conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates shall be
  issued in the name of the state board of education but shall be issued for and on behalf of the
  school board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college district
  requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of qualified electors shall be
  required for the issuance thereof.

    license revenue anticipation certificates, as herein authorized.

    c. To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future requirements for debt
    service or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
    certificates issued on behalf of the school board of such school district or board of trustees
    of such community college district under the authority hereof, whenever the state board
    shall deem it necessary or
    advisable, and in such amounts and under such terms and conditions as the state board
    shall in its discretion determine.

    d. To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school districts or the boards
    of trustees of the community college districts for use in payment of debt service on bonds

    or are to be used, in the acquiring, building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving,
    enlarging, furnishing, equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay
    projects in such school districts or community college districts and which capital outlay

    school district or community college district. The state board shall have power at the time
    of issuance of any bonds by any school board of any school district or board of trustees of
    any community college district to covenant and agree with such school board or board of
    trustees as to the rank and priority of payments to be made for different issues of bonds
    under this subparagraph d., and may further agree that any amounts to be distributed under
    this subparagraph d. may be pledged for the debt service on bonds issued by any school
    board of any school district or board of trustees of any community college district and for
    the rank and priority of such pledge. Any such covenants or agreements of the state board
    may be enforced by any holders of such bonds in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    district on the same basis as such motor vehicle license revenues are distributable to the
    various school districts and community college districts.

    f. To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school districts or boards of
    trustees of the community college districts for the payment of the cost of acquiring,
    building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing, equipping,
    maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects for school purposes in such
    school district or community college district as shall be requested by resolution of the
    school board of the school district or board of trustees of the community college district.

    g. When all major capital outlay needs of a school district or community college district
    have been met as determined by the state board, on the basis of a survey made pursuant to
    regulations of the state board and approved by the state board, all such funds remaining
    shall be distributed annually and used for such school purposes in such school district or
    community college district as the school board of the school district or board of trustees of
    the community college district shall determine, or as may be provided by general law.

  (9) Capital outlay projects of a school district or community college district shall from the
  proceeds of bonds and motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates and from the
  motor vehicle license revenues, only in the order of priority of needs, as shown by a survey or
  surveys conducted in the school district or community college district under regulations
  prescribed by the state board, to determine the capital outlay needs of the school district or
  community college district and approved by the state board; provided that the priority of such
  projects may be changed from time to time upon the request of the school board of the school
  district or board of trustees of the community college district and with the approval of the state
  board; and provided, further, that this paragraph (9) shall not in any manner affect any
  covenant, agreement or pledge made by the state board in the issuance by said state board of
  any bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, or in connection with the
  issuance of any bonds of any school board of any school district or board of trustees of any
  community college district.

  (10) The state board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary
  to the full exercise of the powers herein granted and no legislation shall be required to render
  this amendment of full force and operating effect. The legislature shall not reduce the levies of
  said motor vehicle license revenues during the life of this amendment to any degree which will
  fail to provide the full amount necessary to comply with the provisions of this amendment and
  pay the necessary expenses of administering the laws relating to the licensing of motor
  vehicles, and shall not enact any law having the effect of withdrawing the proceeds of such
  motor vehicle license revenues from the operation of this amendment and shall not enact any
  law impairing or materially altering the rights of the holders of any bonds or motor vehicle
  license revenue anticipation certificates issued pursuant to this amendment or impairing or
  altering any covenant or agreement of the state board, as provided in such bonds or motor
  vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates.

  from said motor vehicle license revenues as provided herein, and if heretofore or hereafter
  authorized by law, may be additionally secured by pledging the full faith and credit of the state
  without an election. When heretofore or hereafter authorized by law, bonds issued pursuant to
  Article XII, Section 18 of the Constitution of 1885, as amended prior to 1968, and bonds
  issued pursuant to Article XII, Section 9, subsection (d) of the Constitution as revised in
  1968, and bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (d), may be refunded by the issuance of
  bonds additionally secured by the full faith and credit of the state.

(e) DEBT LIMITATION.
