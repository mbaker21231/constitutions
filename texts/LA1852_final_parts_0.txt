  ART. 8. Representation in the house of representatives shall be equal and uniform, and

  the State. Each parish shall have at least one representative. No new parish shall be
  created with a territory less than six hundred and twenty-five square miles, nor with a
  population less than the full number entitling it to a representative, nor when the creation
  of such new parish would leave any other parish without the said extent of territory and
  amount of population.
  The first enumeration by the State authorities under this constitution shall be made in the
  year 1853, the second in the year 1858, the third in the year 1865; after which time the
  general assembly shall direct in what manner the census shall be taken, so that it be made
  at least once in every period of ten years, for the purpose of ascertaining the total
  population in each parish and election-district.
  
  At the first regular session of the legislature after the making of each enumeration, the
  legislature shall apportion the representation among the several parishes and election-
  districts on the basis of the total population as aforesaid. A representative number shall be
  fixed, and each parish and election-district shall have as many representatives as its
  aggregate population shall entitle it to, and an additional representative for any fraction
  exceeding one-half the representative number. The number of representatives shall not be
  more than one hundred nor less than seventy.
  Until an apportionment shall be made, and elections held under the same, in accordance
  with the first enumeration to be made as directed in this article, the representation in the
  senate and house of representatives shall be and remain as at present established by law.
  The limits of the parish of Orleans are hereby extended, so as to embrace the whole of the
  present city of New Orleans, including that part of the parish of Jefferson formerly
  known. as the city of La Fayette.
  
  All that part of the parish of Orleans which is situated on the left bank of the Mississippi
  River, shall be divided by the legislature into not more than ten representative districts,
  and until a new apportionment shall be made according to the first census to be taken
  under this constitution, that part of the city of New Orleans which was comprised within
  the former limits of the city of La Fayette shall vote for senators from the parish of
  Orleans, and form the tenth representative district, and shall elect two out of the three
  representatives now apportioned by law to the parish of Jefferson; the other representative
  districts shall remain as they are now established.
