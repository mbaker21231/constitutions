explanation, or both, for the law, section or item, submitted to the electors by referendum
petition, or against any proposed law submitted by supplementary petition, shall be named by the

sum of twenty-five millions ($25,000,000.0) of dollars of the bonds of the state of Ohio, bearing
interest at not to exceed five and one-half per cent per annum, payable semi-annually and
maturing in twenty equal semi-annual installments, commencing not later than the first day of
April, 1923. Such bonds and the interest thereon as income shall be exempt from all taxes levied
by the state of Ohio or any taxing district thereof. The proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall be
paid into the treasury of the state of Ohio, subject to be paid out, without appropriation by the
General Assembly upon the order of the said "The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund", the
same to be known as "The World War Compensation Fund". The said "The Commissioners of
the Sinking Fund" shall by their certificate filed with the auditor of the state, add to the state levy
for taxation, in the year 1922 and thereafter during the life of such bonds, in addition to all other
taxes now or hereafter provided by law, such amounts annually as shall be necessary, as a tax
levy for the retirement of staid bonds, and the payment of the interest thereon; and said levy may
also provide for the payment of the expenses of administration hereof. Such levy shall not be
considered in applying any limitation on aggregate tax rates now or hereafter provided by law.
Said taxes when received shall be paid into a fund in the treasury of the State of Ohio to be paid
out without appropriation by the General Assembly upon the order of the said "The
Commissioners of the Sinking Fund" for the purpose of the payment, or retirement in other
manner, of the said bonds, interest thereon, and expenses of administration hereof. As soon as
may be, the said, "The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund" shall, under such regulations as they
may from time to time promulgate, pay out of said fund to persons resident in Ohio at the time of
the commencement of service who served honorably on active service in the army, navy, or
marine corps of the United States of America or being also citizens of the United States, in
similar forces of any of the governments associated with the United States in the world war, with
the rank or grade of not higher then captain in the army or marine corps, or corresponding grade

adjusted compensation for their full period of active service to the date of separation therefrom,
at the rate of ten ($10.0) dollars per month, but not to exceed two hundred and fifty ($250.0)
dollars. No payment shall be made to any such person, who refused on conscientious, political or
other grounds to subject himself to military discipline or to render unqualified service, or who, 
while in such service, was separated therefrom under circumstances amounting to a dishonorable
discharge. The said "The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund" by order shall make regulations;
providing for the assignment and payment of the whole or part of any of such payment to a fund
to be retained by the said "The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund," for the purpose of erecting
and maintaining, under such laws as shall be enacted for that purpose, hospitals for the relief of
veterans of the world war; providing against any other sale or assignment or fees charged for the
collection of said amounts; providing against the enforcement of the claims of creditors as
against such payments; imposing penalties for violations of such regulations; fixing from time to
time limitations for the presentation of claims for said payments; providing for the contracting
and paying of the necessary expenses of administration hereof and such other regulations as are
deemed necessary and proper for the administration and payment of said fund. The full faith and
credit of the state of Ohio is hereby pledged for the payment of said bonds. The people of the
state of Ohio hereby declare that they have enacted this special amendment to meet the specific
emergency covered thereby and they declare it to be their intention to in no manner affect or
change any of the existing provisions of this constitution except as herein set forth. The
provisions of this section shall be self-executing. Upon the retirement of all of the said bonds and
payment of all claims presented within the limitations of time as prescribed as aforesaid the said
"The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund" shall render a final report to the General Assembly
and any balance remaining in the said funds shall be disposed of as shall be provided by law.

Sec. 35 For the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death,
injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen's employment, laws
may be passed establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by
employers,  and  administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which
payment shall be made therefrom. Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to
compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer
who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall
not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries or
occupational disease. Laws may be passed establishing a board which may be empowered to
classify all occupations, according to their degree of hazard, to fix rates of contribution to such
fund according to such classification, and to collect, administer and distribute such fund
according to such classification, distribute such fund, and to determine all right of claimants
thereto. Such board shall set aside as a separate fund such proportion of the contributions paid by
employers as in its judgment may be necessary, not to  
exceed one per centum thereof in any year, and so as to equalize, insofar as possible, the burden
thereof, to be expended by such board in such manner as may be provided by law for the
investigation and prevention of industrial accidents and diseases. Such board shall have full
power and authority  to hear and determine whether or not an injury, disease or death resulted
because of the failure of the employer to comply with any specific  requirement for the protection
of the lives, health or safety of employees,    enacted by the General Assembly or in the form of
an order adopted by such board, and its decision shall be final; and for the purpose of such
investigations and inquiries it may appoint referees. When it is found, upon hearing, that an
injury, disease or death resulted because of such failure by the employer, such amount as shall be
found to be just, not greater than fifty nor less than fifteen per centum of the maximum award
established by law, shall be added by the board, to the amount of the compensation that may be
awarded on account of such injury, disease, or death, and paid in like manner as other awards;
and, if such compensation is paid from the state fund, the premium of such employer shall be
increased in such amount, covering such period of time as may be fixed, as will recoup the state
fund in the amount of such additional award, notwithstanding any and all other provisions in this

2b. The board of commissioners created by section 8 of Article VIII of the Constitution of the
state of Ohio, designated therein "The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund", shall, forthwith
upon the adoption of this amendment, proceed to issue and sell, from time to time, bonds of the
state if Ohio in such amounts of face value as it may deem necessary to provide the funds, or
such part thereof, as may be required to pay the compensation and the expenses of administering
this section as herein provided for, provided, however, that the aggregate total amount of face
value of bonds so issued shall not exceed three hundred million dollars. The full faith and credit
of the state of Ohio is hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds. All bonds so issued shall
mature in thirty semi-annual installments after the respective dates thereof, and the maturities
thereof shall be so fixed that the total amounts of payments on account of principal and interest
to be paid on each of such semi-annual installment payment dates shall be approximately equal,
but no such bonds shall be issued or bear dates later than the first day of April, 1951. All bonds
so issued shall bear interest at such rates as The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund may fix,
which interest shall be payable semi-annually. Such bonds, and the interest thereon as income,
shall be exempt from  all taxes levied by the state of Ohio or any taxing district thereof. The
bonds may, at the option of the Sinking Fund Commission, be issued subject to call on any
interest payment date at par and accrued interest. All sales of such bonds by The Commissioners
of the Sinking Fund shall be in accordance with such regulations as it shall make and promulgate,
provided, however, that such bonds shall be sold only to the highest bidder or bidders therefor
after notice of such sale shall have been published once each week for three consecutive weeks
on the same day of each of such weeks, the first of such notices being published at least
twenty-one full days before the date of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the
eight most populous counties in the state of Ohio  , and provided that each of such published
notices shall state the day, hour and place of the sale, the total face value of the bonds to be sold,
their denominations, dates, and the dates of their maturities, information relative to the rates of
interest which the bonds will bear, and the dates upon which interest will be payable. The
Commissioners of the Sinking Fund shall have the right to reject any or all bids and to
re-advertise and re-offer bonds for sale. Out of the proceeds of the sale of all bonds that amount
which represents accrued interest, if any, shall be paid into the treasury of the state of Ohio into a
fund to be known as the World War II Compensation Bond Retirement Fund. The balance shall
be paid into the treasury of the state of Ohio into a fund to be known as the World War II
Compensation Fund. The General Assembly of the state of Ohio may appropriate and cause to be
paid into the World War II Compensation Bond Retirement Fund or the World War II
Compensation Fund, out of the funds in the treasury of  the state not otherwise appropriated, such
amounts as it may deem proper for use upon order of The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund
for the purposes for which such funds are created as herein provided. If the General Assembly
should so appropriate any funds to the World War II Compensation Fund prior to the time The
Commissioners of the Sinking Fund shall have issued bonds of the aggregate total amount of face
value authorized in this section, the aggregate total amount of face value of bonds so authorized
to be issued shall be reduced by the amount of the funds so appropriated.

During the period of fifteen years beginning January 1. 1949, the treasurer of state of the state of
Ohio shall, without appropriation thereof by the General Assembly, transfer into said World War
11 Compensation Bond Retirement Fund one million dollars each month out of funds in the state
treasury derived from taxes levied, by the state for the purpose of providing revenues to defray
tile expenses of the state, excepting the taxes levied by the state by sections 53-27, 5541, and
6291 of the General Code of Ohio as the same may be in' effect on the effective (late of this
section. To secure such monthly transfer of funds a lien is hereby created upon all funds coming
into the state treasury after January 1, 1949, derived from taxes as aforesaid, which lien shall be
the first and best lien upon all such funds. It shall be the duty of the treasurer of state to set aside
and use for the purpose of making such monthly transfer of funds, part of each dollar received in
the state treasury ill each calendar year during said period of fifteen years beginning January 1,
1949, derived from taxes as aforesaid, so that the total amount of money so set aside in each of
such calendar years shall be twelve million dollars, and so that the ratio which the amount of
each dollar so set aside shall bear to one dollar shall be the same as the ratio which the amount of
twelve million dollars shall bear to the total amount of money received in the state treasury in
such Calendar years derived from taxes's as aforesaid. The treasurer of state shall set aside such
part of each such dollar before paying out, transferring, or disposing of in any other manner, such
dollar or any part thereof for any other purpose whatsoever. and he shall make the transfer of one
million dollars each month to, the World War 11 Compensation Bond Retirement Fund,
hereinabove provided for, out of said sum of twelve million dollars so set aside in each of such
calendar years.

 The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund shall, on or before the first day of July in each calendar
year, levy and certify to the auditor of the state of Ohio a state tax on all taxable property subject
to taxation on the general tax lists of all counties in the state of Ohio for such year at such rate as
it shall determine to be necessary to provide, together with other money which will - be available
in the World War Il Compensation Bond Retirement Fund, the total amount of funds which will
be required in the next following calendar year for the retirement of bonds and the payment of
interest payable in such year. Such levy shall be in addition to all other taxes levied now or
hereafter within the period, during which bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section
'shall be outstanding, by or pursuant to law or any provision of the Constitution of the state of
Ohio, and shall not be- considered in applying any limitation or aggregate tax rates now or
hereafter within the period during which bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be outstanding, provided by or pursuant to law or any provision of the Constitution of the
state of Ohio. The auditor of the state shall certify such levies to the auditor of each county in the
state of Ohio, who shall extend the same on the tax lists of his county for the year in which such
levy is made and shall place same for collection on the tax duplicates of his county to be
collected as other taxes on such duplicates. Said taxes herein authorized, when collected, shall be
paid into the World War II Compensation Bond Retirement Fund in the treasury of the state. The
World War II Compensation Bond Retirement Fund shall be paid out, without appropriation
thereof by the General Assembly of Ohio, upon the order of The Commissioners of the Sinking
Fund for the purpose of the payment, or retirement in other manner, of said bonds and interest
thereon.

designated in the order in which said groups are herein named; and provided further, that the
surviving husband or wife of more than one deceased person who would be entitled to receive

of record entered on the verdict of the jury shall be set aside or reversed on the weight of the
evidence except by the concurrence of all three judges of a court of appeals. Only a majority of
such court of appeals shall be necessary to pronounce a decision, make an order or enter

judgment upon which they have agreed is in conflict with a judgment pronounced upon the same
question by any other court of appeals of the state, the judges shall certify the record of the case
to the supreme court for review and final determination. The decisions in all cases in the supreme
court shall be reported, together with the reasons therefor, [sic] and laws may be passed

Article VIII

Section 2f.  In addition to the authorization in Article VIII, Section 2e, the state may borrow not
to exceed two hundred fifty million dollars and issue bonds or other obligations therefor, for the
purpose of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and otherwise improving and equipping
buildings and structures, excluding highways; and for the purpose of acquiring lands and interests
in lands for sites for such buildings and structures; and, for the purpose of assisting in the
development of the State, to acquire lands and interests in lands and to develop such lands and
interests or other state lands for water impoundment sites, park and recreational uses, and
conservation of natural resources; and for use in conjunction with federal grants or loans for any
of such purposes.  Of said amount, for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and
otherwise improving and equipping buildings and structures, one hundred seventy-five million
dollars shall be issued for the state supported or assisted colleges or universities including
community colleges, municipal universities, and university branches, thirty-five million dollars
shall be issued for providing classroom facilities for the public schools to be leased or sold by the
State to public school districts unable, within the limitations provided by law, to provide
adequate facilities without assistance from the state, and fifteen million dollars shall be issued for
state functions, activities, offices, institutions, including penal, correctional, mental, and welfare,
and research and development; and for the purpose of assisting in the development of the state by
acquiring lands and interests in lands and to develop such lands and interests or other state lands
for water impoundment sites, park and recreational uses, and conservation of natural resources
twenty-five million dollars shall be issued.  Not more than one hundred million dollars of such
borrowing shall be contracted within any calendar year.  No part of such borrowing shall be
contracted after the thirty-first day of December, 1972.  All bonds or other obligations issued
pursuant to this section shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from date of
issue and in such amounts as shall be fixed by the commissioners of the sinking fund, and shall
bear interest and be sold as shall be authorized by law.  Both the principal of such debt and the
interest thereon shall be exempt from taxation within this state.
  The faith and credit of the state are hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds or other
obligations, and the interest thereon.  They shall be payable from all excises and taxes of the state
except ad valorem taxes on real and personal property, income taxes, and fees, excises or license
taxes relating to registration, operation, or use of vehicles on public highways or to fuels used for
propelling such vehicles.  The excises and taxes of the state from which such bonds and other
obligations shall be paid shall include an excise tax on sales of cigarettes at the rate of one-half
cent on each ten cigarettes or fractional part thereof, and an excise tax on the use, consumption,
or storage for consumption of cigarettes by consumers in this state, at the rate of one-half cent on
each ten cigarettes or fractional part thereof, which shall be levied during the period beginning
with January 1, 1965, and continuing until December 31, 1972, and thereafter as long as any of
such bonds and other obligations are outstanding and moneys in the separate and distinct bond
retirement fund hereinafter created are insufficient to pay all interest, principal, and charges for
the issuance and retirement of such bonds and other obligations.  Such tax on the use,
consumption, or storage for consumption of cigarettes by consumers in this state shall not be
levied upon cigarettes upon which the tax on sales has been paid.  The General Assembly of the
State of Ohio shall enact laws providing for the collection of such taxes.  The moneys received
into the state treasury from such one-half cent excise tax on sales of cigarettes and from such
one-half cent excise tax on the use, consumption, or storage for consumption of cigarettes by
consumers in this state shall be paid into a separate and distinct bond retirement fund hereby
created.  There shall be transferred in each year from said bond retirement fund to the capital
improvements bond retirement fund created by Article VIII, Section 2e of the Constitution of the
State of Ohio, from the proceeds of the levy of such excise taxes on cigarettes, such amounts as
may be necessary for the payment in such year of the interest, principal, and charges of the bonds
or other obligations issued pursuant to said Article VIII, Section 2e falling due in such year, to
the extent that moneys in said capital improvements bond retirement fund in such year are
insufficient to pay such interest, principal, and charges.
  The excise taxes on the sale, use, consumption, or storage of cigarettes authorized to be
levied by Article VIII, Section 2e of the Constitution of the State of Ohio for the payment of
bonds and others obligations issued under authority of that section shall not be levied during any
period that they are not required to be levied by Article VIII, Section 2e of the Constitution of the
State of Ohio.
  Sufficient amounts of such moneys remaining in said separate and distinct bond
retirement fund created by this section, after such transfers, are hereby appropriated for the
purpose of paying interest, principal, and charges for the issuance and retirement of bonds and
other obligations issued under authority of this section, without other appropriations but
according to law.  In the event the moneys in the separate and distinct bond retirement fund
created by this section are at any time insufficient to pay the current interest, principal, and
charges for the issuance and retirement of bonds and other obligations issued under authority of
this section, then such moneys as may be required to pay such current interest, principal, and
charges are hereby appropriated for those purposes, without other appropriations but according to
law, from the proceeds of all excises and taxes excluding those above excepted.  Provision may
be made by law for the transfer and the use of any amount in said separate and distinct bond
retirement fund in excess of that required in any year for payment of interest, principal, and
charges for the issuance and retirement of bonds and other obligations issued under authority of
said Article VIII, Section 2e and this section.
  Any balance remaining in the separate and distinct bond retirement fund created by this
section after payment of all interest, principal, and charges for the issuance and retirement of
bonds or other obligations issued under authority of this section shall be disposed of for the
purposes enumerated in this section as may be provided by law.
  As long as any of such bonds or other obligations are outstanding there shall be levied
and collected in amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds or other
obligations, excises and taxes, excluding those above excepted.

section, may authorize the issuance of obligations, including bonds and notes, of the state or of
state institutions, boards, commissions, authorities, or other state agencies or instrumentalities for
any one or more of the following public capital improvements: the construction, reconstruction,
or other improvement of highways, including those on the state highway system and urban

respect to the foregoing, including participation in any such capital improvements with the
federal government, municipal corporations, counties, or other governmental entities or any one
or more of them which participation may be by grants, loans or contributions to them for any of
such capital improvements. It is hereby determined that such capital improvements will directly
or indirectly create jobs, enhance employment opportunities, and improve the economic welfare
of the people of the state.

The issuance under authority of this section of obligations the holders or owners of which are
given the right to have excises and taxes levied by the general assembly for the payment of the
principal thereof or interest thereon, herein called tax supported obligations, shall be subject to
the following limitations. Not more than one hundred million dollars principal amount may be
issued in any calendar year and not more than five hundred million dollars principal amount may
be outstanding at any one time for such capital improvements for highways 'and research and
development with respect to highways and highway transportation, herein called highway
obligations, provided that fifty per cent of the proceeds of the first five hundred million dollars of
such tax supported highway obligations shall be used for urban extensions of state highways and
highways within or leading to municipal corporations. Not more than two hundred fifty nine
million dollars aggregate principal amount of such tax supported obligations may be issued for
the other capital improvements aforesaid, provided that from the proceeds thereof one hundred

obligations shall not be counted against such limits to the extent that the principal amount thereof
does not exceed the principal amount of the obligations to be retired thereby.

Each issue of tax supported obligations issued pursuant to this section shall mature in not more
than thirty years from the date of issuance thereof, or, if issued to retire obligations issued
hereunder, within thirty years from the date such debt was originally contracted. If such tax
supported obligations are issued as notes in anticipation of the issuance of bonds, provision shall
be made by law for setting aside, so long as such notes are outstanding, into a special fund or
funds such amounts from the sources authorized for payment of such bonds under this section as
would be sufficient for payment of the amount of principal on such bonds that would have been
payable during such period if such bonds, maturing during a period of thirty years, had been
issued without prior issuance of such notes. Such fund or funds may be used solely for the
payment of principal of such notes or of bonds in anticipation of which such notes have been
issued.

The faith and credit and excises and taxes of the state, excluding ad valorem taxes on real or
personal property and income taxes, shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of and
interest on such tax supported obligations, sinking or bond retirement fund provisions shall be
made therefor, and this section shall otherwise be implemented, all in the manner and to the
extent provided by law by the general assembly, including provisions for appropriation of
pledged excises and taxes, and covenants to continue their levy, collection and application, to
continue so long as such tax supported obligations are outstanding, without necessity for further
appropriation notwithstanding Section 22 of Article II, Ohio Constitution; provided that the
moneys referred to in Section 5a of Article XII, Ohio Constitution, herein called highway user
receipts, shall, after provision for payment of amounts pledged to obligations heretofore or
hereafter issued under Sections 2c and 2g of this Article, be pledged to the payment of the
principal of and interest on highway obligations authorized by this section but not to other
obligations authorized hereby. If excises and taxes other than highway user receipts are pledged
to the payment of the principal of or interest on highway obligations authorized by this section in
each year that such highway user receipts are available for such purpose, the same shall be
appropriated thereto and the required application of such other excises and taxes shall be reduced
in corresponding amount.

The general assembly also may authorize the issuance of revenue obligations and other
obligations, the owners or holders of which are not given the right to have excises or taxes levied
by the general assembly for the payment of principal thereof or interest thereon, for such capital
improvements for mental hygiene and retardation, parks and recreation, state supported and state
assisted institutions of higher education, including those for technical education, water pollution
control and abatement, water management, and housing of branches and agencies of state
government, which obligations shall not be subject to other provisions of this section and shall
not be deemed to be debts or bonded indebtedness of the state under other provisions of this
Constitution. Such obligations may be secured by a pledge under law, without necessity for
further appropriation, of all or such portion as the general assembly authorizes of charges for the
treatment or care of mental hygiene and retardation patients, receipts with respect to parks and
recreational facilities, receipts of or on behalf of state supported and state assisted institutions of
higher education, or other revenues or receipts, specified by law for such purpose, of the state or
its officers, departments, divisions, institutions, boards, commissions, authorities, or other state
agencies or instrumentalities, and this provision may be implemented by law to better provide
therefor: provided, however, that any charges for the treatment or care of mental hygiene or
retardation patients may be so pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for
mental hygiene and retardation, any receipts with respect to parks and recreation may be so
pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for parks and recreation, any receipts
of or on behalf of state supported or state assisted institutions of higher education may be
pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for state supported or state assisted
institutions of higher education, and any other revenues or receipts may be so pledged only to
obligations issued for capital improvements which are in whole or in part useful to, constructed
by, or financed by the department, board, commission, authority, or other agency or
instrumentality that receives the revenues or receipts so pledged. The authority provided by this
paragraph is in addition to, cumulative with, and not a limitation upon, the authority of the
general assembly under other provisions of this Constitution; such paragraph does not impair any
law heretofore enacted by the general assembly, and any obligations issued under any such law
consistent with the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to be issued under the authority
of this paragraph.

submit to the electors of the county the question, "shall a county charter commission be chosen?"
the question shall be voted upon at the next general election, occurring not sooner than

containing the question shall bear no party designation provision shall be made thereon for the
election to such commission from the county at large of fifteen electors if a majority of the
electors voting on the question shall have voted in the affirmative.

Candidates for such commission shall be nominated by petition of one per cent of the electors of
the county. The petition shall be filed with the election authorities not less than seventy-five days
prior to such election. Candidates shall be declared elected in the order of the number of votes
received, beginning with the candidate receiving the largest number; but not more than seven
candidates residing in the same city or village may be elected. The holding of a public office does
not preclude any person from seeking or holding membership on a county charter commission
nor does membership on a county charter commission preclude any such member from seeking
or holding other public office, but not more than four officeholders may be elected to a county
charter commission at the same time. The legislative authority shall appropriate sufficient sums
to enable the charter commission to perform its duties and to pay all reasonable expenses thereof.

The commission shall frame a charter for the county or amendments to the existing charter, and
shall, by vote of a majority of the authorized number of members of the commission, submit the
same to the electors of the county, to be voted upon at the next general election next following
the election of the commission. The commission shall certify the proposed charter or
amendments to the election authorities not later than seventy-five days prior to such election.
Amendments to a county charter or the question of the repeal thereof may also be submitted to
the electors of the county in the manner provided in this section for the submission of the
question whether a charter commission shall be chosen, to be voted upon at the first general
election occurring not sooner than sixty days after their submission. The legislative authority or
charter commission submitting any charter or amendment shall, not later than thirty days prior to
the election on such charter or amendment, mail or otherwise distribute a copy thereof to each of
the electors of the county as far as may be reasonably possible except that, as provided by law,
notice of proposed amendments may be given by newspaper advertising. Except as provided in
section 3 of this article, every charter or amendment shall become effective if it has been
approved by the majority of the electors voting thereon. It shall take effect on the thirtieth day
after such approval unless another date be fixed therein. When more than one amendment which
shall relate to only one subject but may affect or include more than one section or part of a
charter-,. is submitted at the same time, they shall be so submitted as to enable the electors to
vote on each separately. In case more than one charter is submitted at the same time or in case of
conflict between the provisions of two or more amendments submitted at the same time, that
charter or provision shall prevail which received the highest affirmative vote, not less than a
majority. If a charter or amendment submitted by a charter commission is not approved by the
electors of the county, the chapter commission may resubmit the same one time, in its original
form or as revised by the charter commission, to the electors of the county at the next succeeding
general election or at any other election held throughout the county prior thereto, in the manner
provided for the original submission thereof.

 The legislative authority of any county, upon petition of ten per cent of the electors of the
county, shall forthwith, by resolution, submit to the electors of the county, in the manner
provided in this section for the submission of the question whether a charter commission shall be
chosen, the question of the adoption of a charter in the form attached to such petition.

 Laws may be passed to provide for the organization and procedures of county charter
commissions, including the filling of any vacancy which may occur, and otherwise to facilitate
the operation of this section. The basis upon which the required number of petitioners in any case
provided for in this  section shall be determined, shall be the total number of votes cast in the
county for the office of governor at the last preceding general election therefor.

 The foregoing provisions of this section shall be self-executing except as herein otherwise
provided.

Article VIII

Section 2n. (A) The General Assembly may provide by law, subject to the limitations of and in
accordance with this section and for the issuance of bonds and other obligations of the state for
the purpose of paying costs of facilities for a system of common schools throughout the state and
facilities for state-supported and state-assisted institutions of higher education.  As used in this
section, "costs" includes, without limitation, the costs of acquisition, construction, improvement,
expansion, planning, and equipping.

(B) The total principal amount of obligations issued under this section shall be as determined by
the General Assembly, subject to the limitation provided for in Section 17 of this Article.

(C) Each obligation issued under this section shall mature no later than the thirty-first day of
December of the twenty-fifth calendar year after its issuance except that obligations issued to
refund other obligations shall mature not later than the thirty-first day of December of the twenty-
fifth calendar year after the year in which the original obligation to pay was issued or entered
into.

(D) Obligations issued under this section are general obligations of the state.  The full faith and
credit, revenue, and taxing power of the state shall be pledged to the payment of debt service on
those outstanding obligations as it becomes due.  For purposes of the full and timely payment of
that debt service, appropriate provisions shall be made or authorized by law for bond retirement
funds, for the sufficiency and appropriation of excises, taxes, and revenues so pledged to that
debt service, for which purpose, notwithstanding Section 22 of Article II of the Ohio
Constitution, no further act of appropriation shall be necessary, and for covenants to continue the
levy, collection, and application of sufficient excises, taxes, and revenues to the extent needed for
that purpose.  Those obligations and the provisions for the payment of debt service on them are
not subject to Sections 5, 6, and 11 of Article XII of the Ohio Constitution.  Moneys referred to
in Section 5a of Article XII of the Ohio Constitution may not be pledged or used for the payment
of the debt service on those obligations.  Moneys consisting of net state lottery proceeds may be
pledged or used for payment of debt service on obligations issued under this section to pay costs
of facilities for a system of common schools, but not on obligations issued under this section to
pay costs of facilities for state-supported and state-assisted institutions of higher education.
  In the case of the issuance of any of those obligations as bond anticipation notes,
provision shall be made by law or in the bond or note proceedings for the establishment and the
maintenance, during the period the notes are outstanding, of special funds into which there shall
be paid, from the sources authorized for payment of the bonds anticipated, the amount that would
have been sufficient to pay the principal that would have been payable on those bonds during that
period if bonds maturing serially in each year over the maximum period of maturity referred to in
Division (C) of this section had been issued without the prior issuance of the notes.  Those
special funds and investment income on them shall be used solely for the payment of principal of
those notes or of the bonds anticipated.

(E) As used in this section, "Debt Service" means principal and interest and other accreted
amounts payable on the obligations referred to.

(F) Obligations issued under this section, their transfer, and the interest, interest equivalent, and
other income or accreted amounts on them, including any profit made on their sale, exchange, or
other disposition, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state.

(G) This section shall be implemented in the manner and to the extent provided by the General
Assembly by law, including provision for the procedure for incurring, refunding, retiring, and
evidencing obligations issued as referred to in this section.

(H) The authorizations in this section are in addition to authorizations contained in other sections
of this article, are in addition to and not a limitation upon the authority of the General Assembly
under other provisions of this constitution, and do not impair any law previously enacted by the
General Assembly.

Section 17. (A) Direct obligations of the state may not be issued under this article if the amount
required to be applied or set aside in any future fiscal year for payment of debt service on direct
obligations of the state to be outstanding in accordance with their terms during such future fiscal
year would exceed five per cent of the total expenditures of the state from the general revenue
fund and net lottery proceeds during the fiscal year immediately preceding issuance.  As used in
this division, "Debt Service" includes the debt service on any bonds proposed to be issued under
this article that are direct obligations of the state, to the extent that debt service is to be paid from
the general revenue fund or net lottery proceeds.

(B) The limitations of division (A) of this section shall not apply to a particular issue or amount
of obligations if the limitations are waived as to that particular issue or amount by the affirmative
vote of at least three-fifths of the members of each house of the General Assembly, or to
obligations issued to retire bond anticipation notes that were issued when the requirements of
division (A) of this section were originally met as estimated for the bonds anticipated.

(C) For purposes of division (A) of this section, debt contracted by the state pursuant to Section 2
of Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or to defend the
state in war, shall not be included in the calculation of total debt service.

(D) For purposes of division (A) of this section, the General Assembly shall provide by law for
computing the amounts required for payment of debt service, and may provide for estimating
payments of debt service on bonds anticipated by notes, for including payments of debt service
on obligations issued to refund or retire prior obligations in lieu of such payments on the prior
refunded or retired obligations, and for the method of computing payments of debt service on any
obligations required to be retired or for which sinking fund deposits are required prior to stated
maturity.  The governor or the governor's designee for such purpose shall determine and certify
the fiscal year amounts required to be applied or set aside for payment of debt service, the
obligations to which that debt service relates, the General Revenue Fund and net lottery proceeds
expenditures of the state, other financial data necessary for the purposes of computations under
division (A) of this section, and the permitted latest maturity of obligations.  That certification
shall be conclusive for the purposes of the validity of any obligations issued under this article.

(E) As used in this section:
(1) "Fiscal year" means the state fiscal year.
(2) "Debt service" means principal and interest and other accreted amounts payable on the
obligations referred to.
(3) "Direct obligations of the state" means issued by the state on which the state of Ohio is the

with this section, for the issuance of bonds and other obligations of the state for the purpose of
paying costs of projects implementing those purposes.

(1) Not more than two hundred million dollars principal amount of obligations issued under this
section for conservation purposes may be outstanding in accordance with their terms at any one

within the fifty-million-dollar fiscal year limit, may be issued in any fiscal year.  Those

taxing power of the state shall not be pledged to the payment of debt service on them.  Those
obligations shall be secured by a pledge of all or such portion of designated revenues and receipts
of the state as the General Assembly authorized, including receipts from designated taxes or
excises, other state revenues from sources other than state taxes or excises, such as from state
enterprise activities, and payments for or related to those revitalization purposes may be or on
behalf of local governmental entities, responsible parties, or others.  The General Assembly shall
provide by law for prohibitions or restrictions on the granting or lending of proceeds of

provision shall be made by law or in the bond or note proceedings for the establishment, and the
maintenance during the period the notes are outstanding, of special funds into which there shall
be paid, from the sources authorized for payment of the particular bonds anticipated, the amount
that would have been sufficient to pay the principal that would have been payable on those bonds
during that period if bonds maturing serially in each year over the maximum period of maturity
referred to in division (D)(1) of this section had been issued without the prior issuance of the
notes.  Those special funds and investment income on them shall be used solely for the payment
of principal of those notes or of the bonds anticipated.

(E) In addition to projects undertaken by the state, the state may participate or assist, by grants,
loans, loan guarantees, or contributions, in the financing of projects for purposes referred to in
this section that are undertaken by local governmental entities or by others, including, but not
limited to, not-for-profit organizations, at the direction or authorization of local governmental
entities.  Obligations of the state issued under this section and the provisions for payment of debt
