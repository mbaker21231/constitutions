51.  The legislature shall not appropriate any money out of the treasury except in accordance with
the following provisions:

Sub-Section A.
* Every appropriation bill shall be either a budget bill, or a supplementary appropriation bill, as
hereinafter mentioned.

Sub-Section B.
* First: Within ten days after the convening of the legislature, unless such time shall be extended
by the legislature for the session at which the budget is to be submitted, the board of public
works, which shall consist of the governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, attorney general,
superintendent of free schools and commissioner of agriculture, shall submit to the legislature
two budgets, one for each of the ensuing fiscal years.  Each budget shall contain a complete plan
of proposed expenditures and estimated revenues for the particular fiscal year to which it relates;
and shall show the estimated surplus or deficit of revenues at the end of such year. 
Accompanying each budget shall be a statement showing: (1) the revenues and expenditures for
each of the two fiscal years next preceding; (2) the current assets, liabilities, reserves, and surplus
or deficit of the state; (3) the debts and funds of the state; (4) an estimate of the state's financial
condition as of the beginning and end of each of the fiscal years covered by the two budgets
above provided; (5) any explanation the board of public works may desire to make as to the
important features of any budget and any suggestions as to methods for the reduction or increase
of the state's revenue.    
* Second: Each budget shall be divided into two parts, and the first part shall be designated
"Governmental Appropriations" and shall embrace an itemized estimate of the appropriations; (1)
for the legislature as certified to the board of public works in the manner hereinafter provided;
(2) for the executive department; (3) for the judiciary department, as provided by law, certified to
the governor by the auditor; (4) to pay and discharge the principal and interest of any debt of the
state of West Virginia hereafter created in conformity with the constitution, and all laws enacted
in pursuance thereof; (5) for the salaries payable by the state under the constitution and laws of
the state; (6) for the aid of public schools in conformity with the laws of the state; (7) for such
other purposes as are set forth in the constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof.
* Third: The second part shall be designated "General Appropriations," and shall include all
other estimates of appropriations.
* The board of public works shall deliver to the presiding officer of each house the budgets and a
bill for all the proposed appropriations of the budgets clearly itemized and classified; and the
presiding officer of each house shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and such
bill shall be known as the "Budget Bill." The board of public works may, before final action
thereon by the legislature, amend or supplement either of said budgets to correct an oversight or
in case of an emergency, with the consent of the legislature, by delivering such an amendment or
supplement to the presiding officers of both houses; and the amendment or supplement shall
thereby become a part of said budget bill as an addition to the items of said bill or as a
modification of or a substitute for any item of said bill the amendment or supplement may affect.
* The legislature shall not amend the budget bill so as to create a deficit but may amend the bill
by increasing or diminishing the items therein relating to the legislature, and by increasing the
items therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may not alter the said
bill except to strike out or reduce items therein; provided, however, that the salary or
compensation of any public officer shall not be increased or diminished during his term of office;
and such bill when and as passed by both houses shall be a law immediately without further
action by the governor.
* Fourth:  The governor and such representatives of the boards, officers and commissions of the
state expending or applying for state's money as have been designated by the board of public
works for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested by either house of the legislature
it shall be their duty to appear and be heard with respect to any budget bill during the
consideration thereof, and to answer inquiries relative thereto.

Subsection C-Supplementary Appropriation Bills
* Neither house shall consider other appropriations until the budget bill has been finally acted
upon by both houses, and no such other appropriations shall be valid except in accordance with
the provisions following: 
* (1) Every such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work,
object or purpose therein stated and called therein a supplementary appropriation bill; (2) each
supplementary appropriation bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation
thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be laid and collected as shall be directed in the bill
unless it appears from such budget that there is sufficient revenue available; (3) No
supplementary appropriation bill shall become a law unless it be passes in each house by a vote
of a majority of the members present, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage.  Each
supplementary appropriation bill shall be presented to the governor of the state as provided in
section fourteen of article seven of the constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said
section shall apply.
* Nothing in this amendment shall be construed as preventing the legislature from passing in
time of war an appropriation bill th provide for the payment of any obligation of the state of West
Virginia within the protection of section ten of article one of the constitution of the United States.

Subsection D--General Provisions
* First:   If the "Budget Bill" shall not have been finally acted upon by the legislature three days
before the expiration of its regular session, the governor may, and it shall be his duty to issue a
proclamation extending the session for such further period as may, in his judgment, be necessary
for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall be considered during such
extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
* Second: The board of public works for the purpose of making up its budgets shall have the
power, and it shall be its duty, to require from the proper state officials, including herein all
executive departments, all executive and administrative officers, bureaus, boards, commissions
and agencies expending or supervising the expenditures of, and all institutions applying for state
moneys and appropriations, such itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at
such times as said board shall direct. The estimates for the legislative department, certified by the
presiding officer of each house, of the judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the auditor, and
for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be transmitted to the board of public works, in
such form and at such times as it shall direct, and shall be included in the budget.
* The board of public works may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may require the
attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies and all institutions applying for
state moneys. After such public hearings it may, in its discretion, revise all estimates except those
for the legislative and judiciary departments, and for the public schools as provided by law.
* Third:  The Legislature may, from time to time, enact such laws, not inconsistent with this
section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
         Fourth:  In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this section and
any of the other provisions of the constitution, except amendments thereto heretofore made and
ratified by the people, the provisions of this section shall prevail. But nothing herein shall be
construed as preventing the governor from calling extraordinary sessions of the legislature, as
provided by section seven of article seven, or as preventing the legislature at such extraordinary
sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or appropriations.
          If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this section shall be
held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality of the bill or of any
other item of such bill or bills.*

hereinafter provided.

Sub-Section B Budget Bills

(2) Within ten days after the convening of the regular session of the Legislature in odd-numbered
years, unless such time shall be extended by the Legislature, and on the second Wednesday of
January in even- numbered years, the Governor shall submit to the legislature a budget for the
next ensuing fiscal year.  The budget shall contain a complete plan of proposed expenditures and
estimated revenues for the fiscal year and shall show the estimated surplus or deficit of revenues
at the end of each fiscal year.  Accompanying each budget shall be a statement showing: (a) An
estimate of the revenues and expenditures for the current fiscal year, including the actual
revenues and actual expenditures to the extent available, and the revenues and expenditures for
the next preceding fiscal year; (b) the current assets, liabilities, reserves, and surplus or deficit of
the State; (c) the debts and funds of the State; (d) an estimate of the State's financial condition as
of the beginning and end of the fiscal year covered by the budget; (e) any explanation the
Governor may desire to make as to the important features of the budget and any suggestions as to
methods for the reduction or increase of the State's revenue.

(3) Each budget shall embrace an itemized estimate of the appropriations, in such form and detail
as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; (a) for the Legislature as
certified to the Governor in the manner hereinafter provided; (b) for the executive department;
(c) for the judiciary department, as provided by law, certified to the Governor by the Auditor; (d)
for payment and discharge of  the principal and interest of any debt of the State created in
conformity with the Constitution, and all laws enacted in pursuance thereof; (e) for the salaries
payable by the State under the Constitution and laws of the State; (f) for such other purposes as
set forth in the Constitution and in laws made in pursuance thereof.
(4) The Governor shall deliver to the presiding officer of each House the budget and a bill for all
the proposed appropriations of the budget clearly itemized and classified, in such form and detail
as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; and the presiding officer of each
House shall promptly cause the bill to be introduced therein, and such bill shall be known as the
"Budget Bill." The Governor may, with the consent of the Legislature, before final action thereon
by the Legislature, amend or supplement the budget to connect an oversight, or to provide funds
contingent on passage of pending legislation, and in case of an emergency, he may deliver such
an amendment or supplement to the presiding officers of both Houses; and the amendment or
supplement shall thereby become a part of the budget bill as an addition to the items of the bill or
as a modification of or a substitute for any item of the bill the amendment or supplement may
affect.
(5) The Legislature shall not amend the budget bill so as to create a deficit but may amend the
bill by increasing or decreasing any item therein: Provided, That no item relating to the judiciary
shall be decreased, and except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the salary or
compensation of any public officer shall not be increased or decreased during his term of office:
Provided further, That the Legislature shall not increase the estimate of revenue submitted in the
budget without the approval of the Governor.
(6) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments, boards, officers and
commissions of the State expending or applying for state moneys as have been designated by the
Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested by either House of the
Legislature it shall be their duty, to appear and be heard with respect to any budget bill, and to
answer inquiries relative thereto.

Subsection C-Supplementary Appropriation Bills
(7) Neither House shall consider other appropriations until the budget bill has been finally acted
upon by both Houses, and no such other appropriations shall be valid except in accordance with
the provisions following: (a) Every such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill
limited to some single work, object or purpose therein stated and called therein a supplementary
appropriation bill; (b) each supplementary appropriation bill shall provide the revenue necessary
to pay the appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be laid and collected as shall
be directed in the bill unless it appears from such budget that there is sufficient revenue available.

Subsection D--General Provisions
(8) If the budget bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature three days before
the expiration of its regular session, the Governor shall issue a proclamation extending the
session for such further period as may, in his judgment, be necessary for the passage of the bill;
but no matter other than the bill shall be considered during such an extension of session except a
provision for the cost thereof.
(9) For the purpose of making up the budget, the Governor shall have the power, and it shall be
his duty, to require from the proper state officials, including herein all executive departments, all
executive and administrative officers, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies expending or
supervising the expenditure of, and all institutions applying for state moneys and appropriations,
such itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as he shall direct.
The estimates for the legislative department, certified by the presiding officer of each House, and
for the judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Auditor, shall be transmitted to the
Governor in such form and at such times as he shall direct, and shall be included in the budget.
(10) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may require the
attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies and all institutions applying for
state moneys. After such public hearings he may, in his discretion, revise all estimates except
those for the legislative and judiciary departments.
(11) Every budget bill or supplementary appropriation bill passed by a majority of the members
elected to each House of the Legislature shall, before it becomes law, be presented to the
Governor. The Governor may veto the bill, or he may disapprove or reduce items or parts of
items contained therein. If he approves he shall sign it and thereupon it shall become a law. The
bill, items or parts thereof, disapproved or reduced by the Governor, shall be returned with his
objections to each House of the Legislature.
Each House shall enter the objections at large upon its journal and proceed to reconsider. If, after
reconsideration, two thirds of the members elected to each House agree to pass the bill, or such
items or parts thereof, as were disapproved or reduced, the bill, items or parts thereof, approved
by two thirds  of such members, shall become law, notwithstanding the objections of the
Governor. In all such cases, the vote of each House shall be determined by yeas and nays to be
entered on the journal.
A bill, item or part thereof, which is not returned by the Governor within five days (Sundays
excepted) after the bill has been presented to him shall become a law in like manner as if he had
signed the bill, unless the Legislature, by adjournment, prevents such return, in which case it
shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State, within five days after such adjournment, and
shall become a law; or it shall be so filed within such five days with the objections of the
Governor, in which case it shall become law to the extent not disapproved by the Governor.
(12) The Legislature may, from time to time, enact such laws, not inconsistent with this section,
as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
(13) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this section and any of the
other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this section shall prevail. But nothing
herein shall be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of the
Legislature, as provided by section nineteen of this article, or as preventing the Legislature at
such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or appropriations.
(14) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this section shall be held
invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality of the bill or of any other
item of such bill or bills.

VIETNAM VETERANS BONUS AMENDMENT
The Legislature shall provide by law, either for the appropriation from the general revenues of
the State, or for the issuance and sale of state bonds, which shall be in addition to all other state
bonds heretofore issued, or a combination of both as the Legislature may determine, for the
purpose of paying a cash bonus to veterans of the armed forces of the United States who were in
active service during the periods hereinafter described. Such bonus shall be paid to all persons
who rendered active service in the armed forces of the United States between the first day of
August, one thousand nine hundred sixty-four, and the date determined by the President or
Congress of the United States as the end of involvement of United States armed forces in the
Vietnam conflict, both dates inclusive, who were bona fide residents of the State of West
Virginia at the time of their entry into such active service and for a period of at least six months
immediately prior thereto, who have not been separated from such service under conditions other
than honorable, and who, within the period specified above, actively served in such armed forces
for a period of at least ninety days. Such bonus shall also be paid to any person, otherwise
eligible under the preceding sentence, who rendered active service in the armed forces of the
United States prior to the first day of August, one thousand nine hundred sixty-four, and who
received the Vietnam armed forces expeditionary medal. Such bonus shall also be paid to any
veteran, otherwise qualified under either of the two sentences next preceding, who was
discharged within ninety days after entering the armed forces because of a service-connected
disability. The amount of such bonus shall be calculated on the basis of twenty dollars per month
for each month of active service, or major fraction thereof, for veterans who received the
Vietnam armed forces expeditionary medal or the Vietnam service medal, up to four hundred
dollars, and ten dollars per month for each month of active service, or major fraction thereof, for
veterans who have not received the Vietnam armed forces expeditionary medal or the Vietnam
service medal, up to three hundred dollars. Not more than one bonus shall be paid to or on behalf
of the service of any one veteran.
The bonus to which any deceased veteran would have been entitled, if living, shall be paid to the
following surviving relatives of such veterans, if such relatives are residents of the State when
such application is made and if such relatives are living at the time payment is made: Any
unremarried widow or widower, or, if none, all children, stepchildren and adopted children
under-the age of eighteen, or, if none, any parent, stepparent, adoptive parent or person standing
in loco parentis. The categories of persons listed shall be treated as separate categories listed in
order of entitlement and where there be more than one member of a class, the bonus shall be paid
to each member according to his proportional share. Where a deceased veteran's death was
connected with such service and resulted from such service during the time period specified,
however, the surviving relatives shall be paid, in accordance with the same order of entitlement,
the sum of five hundred dollars in lieu of any bonus to which the deceased might have been
entitled if living.
The principal amount of any bonds issued for the purpose of paying the bonuses provided for in
this amendment shall not exceed the principal amount of forty million dollars, but may be funded
or refunded either on the maturity dates of said bonds or on any date on which said bonds are
callable prior to maturity, and if any of said bonds have not matured or are not then callable prior
to maturity, the Legislature may nevertheless provide at any time for the issuance of refunding
bonds to fund or refund such bonds on the dates when said bonds mature or on any date on which
said bonds are callable prior to maturity and for the investment or reinvestment of the proceeds
of such refunding bonds in direct obligations of the United States of America until the date or
dates upon which such bonds mature or are callable prior to maturity. The principal amount of
any refunding bonds issued under the provisions of this paragraph shall not exceed the principal
amount of the bonds to be funded or refunded thereby.
The bonds may be issued from time to time for the purposes authorized by this amendment as
separate issues or as combined issues.
Whenever the Legislature shall provide for the issuance of any bonds under the authority of this
amendment, it shall at the same time provide for the levy and collection of an additional cigarette
tax, or a tax on any other tobacco products, or an additional tax on nonintoxicating beer, or an
additional charge on the sale of each bottle of wine or liquor, or an additional general consumers
sales tax, or a graduated income tax, or any combination of one or more thereof, or such other
dedicated tax as the Legislature may determine, in such amount as may be required to pay
annually the interest on such bonds and the principal thereof within and not exceeding thirty

change until his term shall expire, unless sooner removed or retired as authorized in this article.

There shall be at least one judge for each circuit court and as many more as may be necessary to
transact the business of such court.  If there be two or more judges of a circuit court, provision

Property Tax Limitation and Homestead Exemption Amendment of 1982.
1b.Ad valorem property taxation shall be in accordance with this section and other applicable
provisions of this article not inconsistent with this section.
Subsection A-Value; Rate of Assessment; Exceptions
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution and except as otherwise provided in
this section, all property subject to ad valorem taxation shall be assessed at sixty percent of its
value, as directed to be ascertained in this section, except that the Legislature may from time to
time, by general law agreed to by two thirds of the members elected to each house, establish a
higher percentage for the purposes of this paragraph, which percentage shall be uniform as to all
classes of property defined in section one of this article, but not more than one hundred percent
of such value.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred eighty-two,
and the first day of July of each year thereafter until the values may be fixed as a result of the first
statewide reappraisal hereinafter requited, assessments shall be made under the provisions of
current statutory law, which is hereby validated for such purpose until and unless amended by the
Legislature. Assessment and taxation in accord with this section shall be deemed to be equal and
uniform for all purposes.
Subsection B-Determination of Value
The Legislature shall provide by general law for periodic statewide reappraisal of all property,
which reappraisal shall be related for all property to a specified base year which, as to each such
reappraisal, shall be uniform for each appraisal for all classes of property and all counties. In
such law, the Legislature shall provide for consideration of (1) trends in market values over a
fixed period of years prior to the base year, (2) the location of the property, and (3) such other
factors and methods as it may determine: Provided, That with respect to reappraisal of all
property upon the base year of one thousand nine hundred eighty, such reappraisals are deemed
to be valid and in compliance with this section: Provided, however, That with respect to farm
property, as defined from time to time by the Legislature by general law, the determination of
value shall be according to its fair and reasonable value for farming purposes, as may be defined
by general law.
The results of each statewide appraisal shall upon completion be certified and published and
errors therein may be corrected, all as provided by general law. The first such statewide appraisal
shall be completed, certified and published on or before the thirty-first day of March, one
thousand nine hundred eighty-five, for use when directed by the Legislature.
The Legislature shall further prescribe by general law the manner in which each statewide
reappraisal shall be employed to establish the value of the various separately assessed parcels or
interests in parcels of real property and various items of personal property subject to ad valorem
property taxation, the methods by which increases and reductions in value subsequent to the base
year of each statewide reappraisal shall be ascertained, and require the enforcement thereof.
Subsection C--General Homestead Exemption
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution to the contrary, the first twenty
thousand dollars of assessed valuation of any real property, or of personal property in the form of
a mobile home, used exclusively for residential purposes and occupied by the owner or one of the
owners thereof as his residence who is a citizen of this state and who is sixty-five years of age or
older or is permanently and totally disabled as that term may be defined by the Legislature, shall
be exempt from ad valorem property taxation, subject to such requirements, limitations and
conditions as shall be prescribed by general law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution to the contrary, the Legislature shall
have the authority to provide by general law for an exemption from ad valorem property taxation
in an amount not to exceed the first twenty thousand dollars of value of any real property, or of
personal property in the form of a mobile home, used exclusively for residential purposes and
occupied by the owner or one of the owners thereof as his residence who is a citizen of this state,
and who is under sixty-five years of age and not totally and permanently disabled: Provided, That
upon enactment of such general law, this exemption shall only apply to such property in any
county in which the property was appraised at its value as of the first day of January, one
thousand nine hundred eighty, or thereafter, as determined by the Legislature, and this exemption
shall be phased in over such period of time not to exceed five years from the date such property
was so appraised, or such longer time as the Legislature may determine by general law: Provided,
however, That in no event shall any one person and his spouse, or one homestead be entitled to
more than one exemption under these provisions: Provided further, That these provisions are
subject to such requirements, limitations and conditions as shall be prescribed by general law.
The Legislature shall have the authority to provide by general law for property tax relief to
citizens of this State who are tenants of residential or farm property.
Subsection D-Additional Limitations on Value
With respect to the first statewide reappraisal, pursuant to this section, the resulting increase in
value in each and every parcel of land or interest therein and various items of personal property
subject to ad valorem property taxation over and above the previously assessed value shall be
allocated over a period of ten years in equal amounts annually.
The Legislature may by general law also provide for the phasing in of any subsequent statewide
reappraisal of property.
Subsection E--Levies for Free Schools
In equalizing the support of free schools provided by state and local taxes, the Legislature may
require that the local school districts levy all or any portion of the maximum levies allowed under
section one of this article which has been allocated to such local school districts.
Within the limits of the maximum levies permitted for excess levies for schools or better schools
in sections one and ten of this article, the Legislature may, in lieu of the exercise of such powers
by the local school districts as heretofore provided, submit to the voters, by general law, a
statewide excess levy, and if it be approved by the required number of voters, impose such levy,
subject however to all the limitations and requirements for the approval of such levies as in the
case of a district levy. The law submitting the question to the voters shall provide, upon approval
of the levy by the voters, for the assumption of the obligation of any local excess levies for
schools then in force theretofore authorized by the voters of a local taxing unit to the extent of
such excess levies imposed by the state and so as to avoid double taxation of those local districts.
The Legislature may also by general law reserve to the school districts such portions of the power
to lay authorized excess levies as it may deem appropriate to enable local school districts to
provide educational services which are not required to be furnished or supported by the state. If a
statewide excess levy for the support of free schools is approved by the required majority, the
revenue from such a statewide excess levy shall be deposited in the state treasury and be
allocated first for the local obligations assumed and thereafter for such part of the state effort to
support free schools, by appropriation or as the law submitting the levy to the voters shall
require, as the case may be.
The defeat of any such proposed statewide excess levy for school purposes shall not in any way
abrogate or impair any local existing excess levy for such purpose nor prevent the adoption of
any future local excess levy for such purpose.
Subsection F-Implementation
In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this section and other
provisions of this Constitution, the provisions of this section shall prevail. The Legislature shall
have plenary power to provide by general law for the equitable application of this article and, as
to taxes to be assessed prior to the first statewide reappraisal, to make such laws retroactive to the
first day of July, one thousand nine hundred eighty-two or thereafter.

School Levy and Bond Amendment
10. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Constitution to the contrary, the maximum rates
authorized and allocated by law for tax levies on the several classes of property for the support of
public schools may be increased in any school district for a period not to exceed five years, and
in an amount not to exceed one hundred percent of such maximum rates, if such increase is

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Constitution to the contrary, the maximum rates
provided for tax levies by school districts on the several classes of property may be used entirely
for current expense purposes; and all levies required for principal and interest payments on any
bonded indebtedness, now or hereafter contracted, not to exceed five percent on the value of the
taxable property therein, the value to be ascertained in accordance with section eight of this
article, shall be laid separate and apart and in addition to such maximum rates, but in the same
proportions as such maximum rates are levied on the several classes of property.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section eight of this article relating to a vote of the people or
any other provisions of this Constitution, a county board of education may contract indebtedness
and issue bonds for public school purposes as provided by law, if, when submitted to a vote of
the people of the county, in the manner provided by law, the question of contracting indebtedness
and issuing bonds is approved by a majority of the votes cast for and against the same.

QUALIFIED VETERANS HOUSING BONDS AMENDMENT
1. The Legislature shall have the power to authorize the issuing and selling of general obligation
bonds of the State which shall be in addition to all other state bonds heretofore authorized. The
aggregate annual amount payable on all such bonds, including both principal and interest, shall
be limited such that the debt service accruing on such bonds in any fiscal year shall not exceed
$35,000,000, exclusive of any amounts payable on such bonds for which moneys or securities
have been irrevocably set aside and dedicated solely for the purpose of such payment. The
proceeds of the bonds hereby authorized to be issued and sold shall be used and appropriated to
provide financing for owner-occupied residences for persons determined by the Legislature to be
qualified veterans, except that (i) part of the proceeds from each separate issuance of bonds may
be set aside as a reserve for the purposes of the Veterans' Mortgage Fund herein authorized and
(ii) proceeds may be dedicated for the payment of principal, redemption price or interest on any
such bonds to be refunded. Such bonds may be issued and sold at such time or times and in such
amount or amounts as the Legislature shall authorize. All proceeds of such bonds, and all
revenues derived from the use and investment of such proceeds, shall be deposited in a separate
fund of the State, designated as the Veterans' Mortgage Fund. Amounts in such fund shall be
used solely for the purposes of making loans for qualified veterans, providing for the payment or
redemption of such bonds and the interest thereon, and providing for the payment of necessary
expenses in connection therewith. When a bond issue as aforesaid is authorized, the Legislature
shall at the same time provide for the collection of an annual state tax sufficient to pay as it may
accrue the interest on such bonds and the principal thereof within and not exceeding forty years,
and all such taxes so levied shall be irrevocably dedicated for the payment of principal of and
interest on such bonds until the obligation of the State with respect to the payment of such
principal and interest has been discharged, and any of the covenants, agreements or provisions in
the acts of the Legislature levying such taxes shall be enforceable in any court of competent
jurisdiction by any of the holders of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied in any year only to the
extent that the moneys on deposit in the Veteran's Mortgage Fund are insufficient to pay all
amounts accruing on such bonds in such year.
II. The Legislature shall have the power to enact legislation to implement the provisions of this
amendment.

which reappraisal shall be related for all property to a specified base year which, as to each such
reappraisal, shall be uniform for each appraisal for all classes of property and all counties. In
such law, the Legislature shall provide for consideration of (1) trends in market values over a
fixed period of years prior to the base year, (2) the location of the property, and (3) such other
factors and methods as it may determine: Provided, That with respect to reappraisal of all
property upon the base year of one thousand nine hundred eighty, such reappraisals are deemed
to be valid and in compliance with this section: Provided, however, That with respect to farm
property, as defined from time to time by the Legislature by general law, the determination of
value shall be according to its fair and reasonable value for farming purposes, as may be defined
by general law.
The results of each statewide appraisal shall upon completion be certified and published and
errors therein may be corrected, all as provided by general law. The first such statewide appraisal
shall be completed, certified and published on or before the thirty-first day of March, one
thousand nine hundred eighty-five, for use when directed by the Legislature.
The Legislature shall further prescribe by general law the manner in which each statewide
reappraisal shall be employed to establish the value of the various separately assessed parcels or
interests in parcels of real property and various items of personal property subject to ad valorem
property taxation, the methods by which increases and reductions in value subsequent to the base
year of each statewide reappraisal shall be ascertained, and require the enforcement thereof.
Subsection C--General Homestead Exemption
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution to the contrary, the first twenty
thousand dollars of assessed valuation of any real property, or of personal property in the form of
a mobile home, used exclusively for residential purposes and occupied by the owner or one of the
owners thereof as his residence who is a citizen of this state and who is sixty-five years of age or
older or is permanently and totally disabled as that term may be defined by the Legislature, shall
be exempt from ad valorem property taxation, subject to such requirements, limitations and
conditions as shall be prescribed by general law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution to the contrary, the Legislature shall
have the authority to provide by general law for an exemption from ad valorem property taxation
in an amount not to exceed the first twenty thousand dollars of value of any real property, or of
personal property in the form of a mobile home, used exclusively for residential purposes and
occupied by the owner or one of the owners thereof as his residence who is a citizen of this state,
and who is under sixty-five years of age and not totally and permanently disabled: Provided, That
upon enactment of such general law, this exemption shall only apply to such property in any
county in which the property was appraised at its value as of the first day of January, one
thousand nine hundred eighty, or thereafter, as determined by the Legislature, and this exemption
shall be phased in over such period of time not to exceed five years from the date such property
was so appraised, or such longer time as the Legislature may determine by general law: Provided,
however, That in no event shall any one person and his spouse, or one homestead be entitled to
more than one exemption under these provisions: Provided further, That these provisions are
subject to such requirements, limitations and conditions as shall be prescribed by general law.
The Legislature shall have the authority to provide by general law for property tax relief to
citizens of this State who are tenants of residential or farm property.
Subsection D-Additional Limitations on Value
With respect to the first statewide reappraisal, pursuant to this section, the resulting increase in
value in each and every parcel of land or interest therein and various items of personal property
subject to ad valorem property taxation over and above the previously assessed value shall be
allocated over a period of ten years in equal amounts annually.
The Legislature may by general law also provide for the phasing in of any subsequent statewide
reappraisal of property.
Subsection E--Levies for Free Schools
In equalizing the support of free schools provided by state and local taxes, the Legislature may
require that the local school districts levy all or any portion of the maximum levies allowed under
section one of this article which has been allocated to such local school districts.
Within the limits of the maximum levies permitted for excess levies for schools or better schools
in sections one and ten of this article, the Legislature may, in lieu of the exercise of such powers
by the local school districts as heretofore provided, submit to the voters, by general law, a
statewide excess levy, and if it be approved by the required number of voters, impose such levy,
subject however to all the limitations and requirements for the approval of such levies as in the
case of a district levy. The law submitting the question to the voters shall provide, upon approval
of the levy by the voters, for the assumption of the obligation of any local excess levies for
schools then in force theretofore authorized by the voters of a local taxing unit to the extent of
such excess levies imposed by the state and so as to avoid double taxation of those local districts.
The Legislature may also by general law reserve to the school districts such portions of the power
to lay authorized excess levies as it may deem appropriate to enable local school districts to
provide educational services which are not required to be furnished or supported by the state. If a
statewide excess levy for the support of free schools is approved by the required majority, the
revenue from such a statewide excess levy shall be deposited in the state treasury and be
allocated first for the local obligations assumed and thereafter for such part of the state effort to
support free schools, by appropriation or as the law submitting the levy to the voters shall
require, as the case may be.
The defeat of any such proposed statewide excess levy for school purposes shall not in any way
abrogate or impair any local existing excess levy for such purpose nor prevent the adoption of
any future local excess levy for such purpose.
Subsection F-Implementation
In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this section and other
provisions of this Constitution, the provisions of this section shall prevail. The Legislature shall
have plenary power to provide by general law for the equitable application of this article and, as
to taxes to be assessed prior to the first statewide reappraisal, to make such laws retroactive to the
first day of July, one thousand nine hundred eighty-two or thereafter.

Taxation and Finance
1. Subject to the exceptions in this section contained, taxation shall be equal and uniform
throughout the State, and all property, both real and personal, shall be taxed in proportion to its
value to be ascertained as directed by law. No one species of property from which a tax may be
collected shall be taxed higher than any other species of property of equal value; except that the
aggregate of taxes assessed in any one year upon personal property employed exclusively in
agriculture, including horticulture and grazing, products of agriculture as above defined,
including livestock, while owned by the producer, and money, notes, bonds, bills and accounts
receivable, stocks and other similar intangible personal property shall not exceed fifty cents on
each one hundred dollars of value thereon and upon all property owned, used and occupied by the
owner thereof exclusively for residential purposes and upon farms occupied and cultivated by
their owners or bona fide tenants, one dollar; and upon all other property situated outside of
municipalities, one dollar and fifty cents; and upon all other property situated within
municipalities, two dollars; and the Legislature shall further provide by general law for
increasing the maximum rates authorized to be fixed by the different levying bodies upon all
classes of property by submitting the question to the voters of the taxing units affected, but no
increase shall be effective unless at least sixty percent of the qualified voters shall favor such
increase, and such increase shall not continue for a longer period than three years at any one time,
and shall never exceed by more than fifty percent the maximum rate herein provided and
prescribed by law; and the revenue derived from this source shall be apportioned by the
Legislature among the levying units of the State in proportion to the levy laid in said units upon
real and other personal property; but property used for educational, literary, scientific, religious
or charitable purposes, all cemeteries, public property, the personal property, including livestock,
employed exclusively in agriculture as above defined and the products or agriculture as so
defined while owned by the producers may by law be exempted from taxation; household goods
to the value of two hundred dollars shall be exempted from taxation. The Legislature shall have
authority to tax privileges, franchises, and income of persons and corporations and to classify and
graduate the tax on all incomes according to the amount thereof and to exempt from taxation
incomes below a minimum to be fixed from time to time, and such revenues as may be derived
from such tax may be appropriated as the Legislature may provide. After the year nineteen
hundred thirty-three, the rate of the state tax upon property shall not exceed one cent upon the
hundred dollars valuation, except to pay the principal and interest of bonded indebtedness of the
State now existing.

Provided, That intangible personal property may be made subject to such taxation only to the
extent provided by the Legislature by general law not inconsistent with this section.
The Legislature shall not impose ad valorem property taxation upon money, bank deposits and
other investments determined by such law to be in the nature of deposits in a bank or other
financial institution, or upon pensions, monies or investments determined by the Legislature in
such law to be in lieu of or otherwise in the nature of pensions.
The Legislature by general law may exempt from such taxation any amount of the value of all or
certain intangible personal property and any type, group or class of such intangibles but such
exemptions shall be uniform throughout the state. No tax imposed upon such intangibles shall be
at a rate or rates in excess of the maximum rate permitted to be imposed upon personal property
employed exclusively in agriculture as provided in sections one, one-b or ten of this article, as the
case may be, in the county wherein the intangible personal property has situs, as such situs is
determined by the Legislature in such general law.
The valuations with respect to property acquired or created subsequent to any statewide
reappraisal and the valuations with respect to any intangible personal property subjected to ad
valorem property taxation pursuant to this section shall be allocated and phased-in over a period
of years and be valued with respect to the same base year as other property subject to ad valorem
property taxation in order to provide for equitable and similar treatment of such property
subsequently acquired or created or such intangible personal property as compared to similarly
situated previously existing property of similar value whose owner is receiving the benefit of any
allocation and phase-in allowed pursuant to section one-b of this article.
Any intangible personal property which would be subject to ad valorem property taxation under
prior provisions of this Constitution shall continue to be subjected to such taxation as provided
by and in accordance with current statutory law for the assessment of such taxes upon such
property, which laws are hereby validated for such purpose or purposes, until the first day of July
in the year one thousand nine hundred eighty-five, or until the first statewide reappraisal of
property pursuant to section one-b of this article shall be first implemented and employed to fix
values for ad valorem property taxation, whichever shall last occur, and thereafter no intangible
personal property shall be subject to such taxation save for and except as provided by the
Legislature by general law enacted after the ratification of the amendment of this section in the
year one thousand nine hundred eighty-four.

this amendment shall not exceed the principle amount of four million dollars, but may be funded
or refunded either on the maturity dates of said bonds or on any date on which said bonds are
callable prior to maturity, and if any said bonds have not matured or are not then callable prior to

bonds to fund or refund such bonds on the dates when said bonds mature or on any date on which
said bonds are callable prior to maturity and for the investment or reinvestment of the proceeds
of such refunding bonds in direct obligations of the United States of America until the date or
dates upon which such bonds mature or are callable prior to maturity. The principal amount of
any refunding bonds .issued under the provisions of this paragraph shall not exceed the principal
amount of the bonds to be funded or refunded thereby.

amendment, it shall at the same time provide for the levy, collection and dedication of an
additional tax, or enhancement to such other tax as the Legislature may determine, in such
amount as may be required to pay annually the interest on such bonds and the principle thereof

revenue generated in excess of that which is required to pay the bonuses provided herein and to
pay any administrative cost associated with such payment shall be used to pay the principal and
interest on any bonds issued as soon as is economically practicable.
