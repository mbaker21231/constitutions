people are led to forget the real distinction in the crimes themselves, and to commit the most
flagrant with as little compunction as they do the slightest offences. For the same reasons, a
multitude of sanguinary laws are both impolitic and unjust;  the true design of all punishments
being to reform, not to exterminate, mankind.
