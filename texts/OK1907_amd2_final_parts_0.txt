Article 9, section 19
19.   In all matters pertaining to the public visitation, regulation, or control of corporations, and within
the jurisdiction of the Commission, it shall have the powers and authority of a court of record, to
administer oaths, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of papers, to punish for
contempt any person guilty of disrespectful or disorderly conduct in the presence of the Commission
while in session, and to enforce compliance with any of its lawful orders or requirements by adjudging,
and by enforcing its own appropriate process, against the delinquent or offending party or company
(after it shall have been first duly cited, proceeded against by due process of law before the
Commission sitting as a court, and afforded opportunity to introduce evidence and to be heard, as well
against the validity, justness, or reasonableness of the order or requirement alleged to have been
violated, as against the liability of the company for the alleged violation), such fines or other penalties as
may be prescribed or authorized by this Constitution or by law.  The Commission may be vested with
such additional powers, and charged with such other duties (not consistent with this Constitution) as
may be prescribed by law, in connection with the visitation, regulation, or control of corporations, or
with the prescribing and enforcing of rates and charges to be observed in the conduct of any business
where the State has the right to prescribe the rates and charges in connection therewith, or with the

the investigation of the subject of taxation generally.  Any corporation failing or refusing to obey any
valid order or requirement of the Commission, within reasonable time, not less than ten days, as shall be
fixed in the order, may be fined by the Commission (proceeding by due process of law as aforesaid)
such sum, not exceeding five hundred dollars, as the Commission may deem proper, or such sum, in
excess of five hundred dollars, as may be prescribed or authorized by law; and each day's continuance
of such failure or refusal, after due service upon such corporation of the order or requirement of the
Commission, shall be a separate offense: Provided, That should the operation of such order or
requirement be suspended, pending any appeal therefrom, the period of such suspension shall not be
computed against the company in the matter of its liability to fines or penalties.

Article 9, section 20
20.   From any action of the Corporation Commission prescribing rates, charges, services, practices,
rules or regulations of any public utility or public service corporation, or any individual, person, firm,
corporation, receiver or trustee engaged in the public utility business, an appeal may be taken by any
party affected, or by any person deeming himself aggrieved by any such action, or by the State, directly
to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, in the manner and in the same time in which appeals
may be taken to the Supreme Court from the District Courts, except that such an appeal shall be of
right, and the Supreme Court may provide by rule for proceedings in the matter of appeals in any
particular in which the existing rules of law are inapplicable.  If such appeal be taken by the public utility
or public service corporation affected by any such action, the State of Oklahoma shall be made the
appellee, but in other appeals hereunder, the public utility or public service corporation affected shall be
made the appellee.

   An appeal from an order of the Corporation Commission affecting the rates, charges, services,
practices, rules or regulations of public utilities, or public service corporation, shall be to the Supreme
Court only, and in all appeals to which the State is a party it shall be represented by the Attorney for
the Corporation Commission, and the Attorney General, or his duly authorized representatives.

   The Supreme Court's review of appealable orders of the Corporation Commission shall be judicial
only, and in all appeals involving an asserted violation of any right of the parties under the Constitution
of the United States of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma, the Court shall exercise its own
independent judgment as to both the law and the facts.  In all other appeals from orders of the
Corporation Commission the review by the Supreme Court shall not extend further than to determine
whether the Commission has regularly pursued its authority, and whether the findings and conclusions of
the Commission are sustained by the law and substantial evidence.  Upon review, the Supreme Court
shall enter judgment, either affirming or reversing the order of the Commission appealed from.

   No court of this State, except the Supreme Court, shall have jurisdiction to review, affirm, reverse, or
remand any action of the Corporation Commission with respect to the rates, charges, services,
practices, rules or regulations of public utilities, or of public service corporations, or to suspend or delay
the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, reverse, or interfere with the Corporation Commission
in the performance of its official duties; provided, however, that writs of mandamus or prohibition shall
lie from the Supreme Court to the Corporation Commission in all cases where such writs respectively
would lie to any inferior court or officer.

Article 9, section 21
21.  Upon the giving of notice of appeal from an order of the Corporation Commission, the
Commission, if requested, shall suspend the effectiveness of the order complained of until the final
disposition of the order appealed, and fix the amount of suspending or supersedeas bond.  Such
suspending or supersedeas bond shall be approved and filed with the Corporation Commission (or
approved, on review, by the Supreme Court), and made payable to the State of Oklahoma; provided,
however, that in all cases involving orders of the Corporation Commission affecting rates or charges,
the suspending or supersedeas bond must be sufficient in amount and security to insure the prompt
refunding, by the appealing party, to the parties entitled thereto, of all rates or charges which such
appealing party may collect or receive, pending the appeal, in excess of those authorized by the order
appealed from, in event such order is, by such court, affirmed on appeal.  The Corporation
Commission, upon the executive of such suspending or supersedeas bond, shall forthwith require the
appealing party, under penalty of immediate enforcement (pending the appeal and notwithstanding any
supersedeas), of the order appealed from, to keep such accounts, and make to the Corporation
Commission, from time to time, such reports, verified by oath, as may, in the judgment of the
Corporation Commission, suffice to show the amounts being charged or received by the appealing
party, pending the appeal, in excess of the charge allowed by the order or action of the Corporation
Commission appealed from, together with the names and addresses of the persons to whom such
overcharges may be refundable, in case such charges made by the appealing party, pending the appeal,
be not sustained on such appeal; and the Corporation Commission shall also, from time to time, require
such appealing party, under like penalty, to give additional security, or to increase such suspending
bond, whenever, in the opinion of the Corporation Commission, the same may be necessary to secure
the prompt refunding of the overcharges aforesaid.  Upon the final decision of the appeal, all amounts
which the appealing party may have collected, pending the appeal, in excess of that authorized by such
final decision, shall be promptly refunded by the appealing party to the parties entitled thereto, in such
manner and through such method of distribution, as may be prescribed by the Corporation
Commission, or by law.  All such appeals, affecting the rates, charges, practices, rules or regulations of
any public utility, or of any public service corporation, or any individual, person, firm, corporation,
receiver or trustee engaged in the public utility business, shall have precedence upon the docket of the
Supreme Court, irrespective of its place of session, next after habeas corpus cases, to the end that a

exemption provided by this section in order to promote full employment of labor resources within the
state; provided, however, that a manufacturing facility that qualifies for the ad valorem tax exemption
provided by this section, pursuant to the definition of "manufacturing facility" then applicable, shall be

reimbursement to common schools, county governments, cities and towns, emergency medical services
districts, vocational-technical schools, junior colleges, county health departments and libraries for
revenues lost to such entities as a result of the exemption provided by this section.

Article 10, section 8-A
8-A.  (a) If a county approves an exemption of household goods of the heads of families and livestock
employed in support of the family from taxation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Section
6 of this article, the millage rate levied against the net taxable valuation of all property of each taxing
jurisdiction located within such county levying ad valorem taxes for a general fund or a building fund
shall be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section to compensate for the
potential loss of revenue to the taxing jurisdiction directly attributable to the exemption of all such
property.  For purposes of this section, "taxing jurisdiction" shall include, but not be limited to, counties,
cities, towns, common school districts, vocational-technical school districts and any other unit of
government authorized to collect ad valorem taxes from millage levied against the taxable value of
property.

   (b) The adjusted millage rate for a general fund or building fund of each taxing jurisdiction located
within a county which exempts household goods of the heads of families and livestock employed in
support of the family from ad valorem taxation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 6
of this Article shall be computed, for each taxing jurisdiction, by dividing the net taxable valuation of all
property for the year preceding the year in which the exemption of such property becomes effective by
the difference between the net taxable valuation of all property for the year preceding the year in which
the exemption of such property becomes effective and the net taxable valuation of the household goods
of the heads of families and livestock employed in support of the family for the year preceding the year
in which the exemption of such property becomes effective.  The resulting quotient shall be the millage
adjustment factor, and shall be multiplied by the millage rate which would otherwise have been applied
for the year in which the exemption of such property becomes effective to derive the adjusted millage
rate, which shall be levied against the net taxable valuation of all property, other than the exempt
property, within the jurisdiction for the year in which the exemption of household goods of the heads of
families and livestock employed in support of the family becomes effective; provided, such adjusted
millage rate may be increased or decreased in the manner provided by the provisions of this Article.

   (c) If a county approves an exemption of household goods of the heads of families and livestock
employed in support of the family from ad valorem taxation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b)
of Section 6 of this article, the maximum allowable millage for any millage levied by any taxing
jurisdiction located within such county for a general fund or building fund, as prescribed by Sections 9,
9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 10, 10A, 10B and 35 of this article or as otherwise authorized by Section 36 of
Article V of the Oklahoma Constitution, shall be adjusted by multiplying such millage by the millage
adjustment factor as specified in subsection (b) of this section.  The resulting product shall be the
adjusted maximum allowable millage for that particular millage levied by such taxing jurisdiction for a
general fund or building fund.

   (d) If approved by the people, this section will become effective January l, 1993.

proclamation, and may be increased in a later election, not to exceed a total levy of three (3) mills. This
special levy shall be in addition to all other levies and when authorized shall be made each fiscal year
thereafter.

   Each district which is herein authorized, or established, shall have a board of trustees composed of
not less than five members.  Such trustees shall be chosen jointly by the board or boards of county
commissioners, provided that such membership shall be composed of not less than one individual from
each county or part thereof which is included in said district.  

   Original members of the board of trustees shall hold office, as follows: At the first meeting of said
board, board members shall draw lots to determine each trustee's original length of term in office.  The
number of lots to be provided shall be equal to the number of original members of the board, and lots
shall be numbered sequentially from one through five, with lots in excess of the fifth lot being numbered
sequentially from one through five until all lots are numbered.  Each original member or members added
by an expansion area of the board shall hold office for the number of years indicated on his or her lot. 
Each year, as necessary, the board or boards of county commissioners shall appoint successors to such
members of the board of trustees whose terms have expired, and such subsequent appointments shall
be for terms of five (5) years.

   Such board of trustees shall have the power and duty to promulgate and adopt such rules, procedures
and contract provisions necessary to carry out the purposes and objectives of these provisions, and
shall individually post such bond as required by the county commissioners, which shall not be less than
Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.0).

   The district board of trustees shall have the additional powers to hire a manager and appropriate
personnel, contract, organize, maintain or otherwise operate the emergency medical services within said
district and such additional powers as may be authorized by the Legislature.

   (b) Any district board of trustees may issue bonds, if approved by a majority vote at a special
election for such purpose.  All registered voters within the designated district shall have the right to vote
in said election.  Such bonds shall be issued for the purpose of acquiring emergency vehicles and other
equipment and maintaining and housing the same.

   (c) The bonds authorized above shall not bear interest at a greater rate than that authorized by statute
for the issuance of city municipal bonds.  Such bonds shall be sold only at public sale after twenty (20)
days' advertisement in a newspaper for publication of legal notices with circulation in the district.  Any
district may refund its bonds as is now provided by law for refunding municipal bonds.

   (d) Any district board of trustees, upon issuing bonds as authorized in subsection (b) of this section,
shall levy a special annual ad valorem tax upon the property within the district, payable annually, in a
total amount not to exceed three (3) mills on the dollar, on the real and personal taxable property in
such district, for the payment of principal and interest on outstanding bonds, until same are paid. 
However, the trustees may, from time to time, suspend the collection of such annual levy when not
required for the payment of the bonds.  In no event shall the real and personal taxable property in any
city or town be subject to a special tax in excess of three (3) mills for the payment of bonds issued
hereunder.
    
   (e) There may also be pledged to the payment of principal and interest of the bonds herein authorized
to be issued: (1) any net proceeds from operation of the district that the board of trustees of the district
shall deem not necessary to the future operation and maintenance of said emergency medical service; or
(2) any monies available from other funds of the district not otherwise obligated.

   (f) Bonds shall be issued for designated sums with serial numbers thereon and maturing annually after
three (3) years from date of issue.  All bonds and interest thereon shall be paid upon maturity and no
bonds shall be issued for a period longer than thirty (30) years.  Any district board of trustees may in its
discretion schedule the payment of principal over the thirty-year period so that when interest is added
there will be approximately level annual payments of principal and interest.

   (g) In the event the mill levy as set forth in the original election proclamation is less than three (3) mills,
the board of trustees may request the county commissioners to call a subsequent election to consider
increasing the mill levy; provided, however, the total levy authorized by subsection (a) hereof shall not
exceed three (3) mills.

   (h) The board of trustees of any district shall have jurisdiction over the sale or refunding of any bonds
issued by the district and shall be responsible for the economical expenditure of the funds derived from
the bonds.

   (i) Such districts shall be empowered to charge fees for services, and accept gifts, funds or grants
from sources other than the mill levy, which shall be used and accounted for in a like manner.  Persons
served outside the district shall be charged an amount equal to the actual costs for the service, not
taking into account any income the district receives from millage or sources within the district.  The
board of trustees shall have legal authority to bring suits necessary to collect accounts owed and to sue
and defend as necessary for the protection of the board.  The State Auditor and Inspector shall conduct
an annual audit of the operations of such districts.

   (j) Any emergency medical service district may expand to include other counties or parts thereof,
provided that an election is called by the county commissioners whose county or counties, or parts
thereof, are to be added to in the established district; and provided further, that the county
commissioners in the original district concur in the calling of said election.  The proposed expansion
area shall only be added to the original district if approved separately by a majority vote, by the voters
in both the original district and in the expansion area, at an election called for that purpose.  The county
in which the expansion area is located shall have not less than one member on the board of trustees. 
Appropriate millage or other approved method of financial support shall be levied in the expansion
area, when said area is added to the original district which millage shall be levied at the rate used to
cover operational costs and outstanding bonded indebtedness as provided in Section 9C, (d) and (e),
Article X.

   (k) Any county or parts thereof may withdraw from a district provided that an election is called by the
county commissioners for the county whose county or parts thereof is to be withdrawn from the district. 
The county or parts thereof shall be withdrawn from the district if approved by a majority vote of the
voters in the county at an election called for such purpose.  If the county commissioners are presented a
petition signed by not less than twenty percent (20%) of all registered voters in the county, the county
commissioners shall call an election.  The petition for an election for a county or parts thereof to
withdraw from a district and the ballot shall provide for the payment of any debt for operational costs
and outstanding bonded indebtedness in proportional shares, for which the county or parts thereof
would be responsible as a result of the membership of the county or parts thereof in the district.

   (l) Any district may be dissolved, or the millage levy changed, by a majority vote of the registered
voters voting at an election called for that purpose by the county commissioners of each county or part
thereof included within the district; provided that such an election shall not be called unless either three-
fifths (3/5 ) of the trustees of such district request the county commissioners to call such an election, or
the respective county commissioners are presented a petition signed by not less than twenty percent
(20%) of all registered voters in the district.

   (m) In the event a district is dissolved, any mill levy used to support, organize, operate and maintain
the emergency medical service district shall cease, provided that such mill levy shall not cease until all
outstanding emergency medical service bonds of that district are retired and all other debts incurred by
the emergency medical services district have been satisfied.

   (n) All elections called under the provisions hereof shall be conducted by the county election board or
boards of each county or counties involved, upon receipt of an election proclamation, issued by a
majority of the board or boards of county commissioners in the area affected.  In the event more than
one county is involved, said proclamation must be a joint proclamation from a majority of the board of
county commissioners of each county involved.  Said proclamation shall be published in one issue of a
newspaper of general circulation in each county involved in the area affected at least ten (10) days prior
to said election, and said proclamation shall set forth the purpose of the election, and the date thereof. 
The county election board or boards shall certify the results of an election to the board or boards
issuing such proclamation.

   (o) The board of any district shall have capacity to sue and be sued.  Provided, however, the board
shall enjoy immunity from civil suit for actions or commissions arising from the operation of the district,
so long as, and to the same extent as, municipalities and counties within the state enjoy such immunity.

   (p) In lieu of proceeding to establish a district as outlined hereinabove through the county
commissioners, the governing body of any incorporated city or town may proceed to form a district,
join an existing district or join with other incorporated cities or towns in forming a district.  In such case,
said governing body shall be considered as being substituted as to the powers and duties of said county
commissioners as set forth hereinabove; provided, further, said city or town shall be considered as
being substituted as to the powers and duties of a district formed, as set forth hereinabove.  All rights,
duties, privileges and obligations of the residents and voters in such city or town shall be the same as
those outlined for the district as set forth above.

Article 10, section 9-D
9-D.  A.  The board of county commissioners of any county may call a special election to determine
whether or not the board shall provide solid waste management services for the county.  An election
shall also be called by the board upon petition signed by not less than ten percent (10%) of the
registered voters of the county.  All registered voters in such county shall be entitled to vote, as to
whether or not such services shall be provided, and at the same time and in the same question authorize
a tax levy of not to exceed three (3) mills for the purpose of providing funds for the purpose of support,
organization, operation and maintenance of such services.  If the provision of the services and the mill
levy is approved by a majority of the votes cast, a special annual recurring ad valorem tax levy of not
more than three (3) mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of all taxable property in the county
shall be levied.  The number of mills shall be set forth in the election proclamation, and may be
increased in a later election, not to exceed a total levy of three (3) mills.  This special levy shall be in
addition to all other levies and when authorized shall be made each fiscal year thereafter.

   B.  Upon passage of the question, the board of county commissioners shall provide solid waste
management services for county residents and businesses.  The board may provide for one or more
disposal facilities and for solid waste collection services.  The board may purchase landfill sites,
construct and operate landfills and transfer stations and other solid waste disposal and handling
facilities.  The board shall provide a solid waster disposal and collection system for the county, using the
funds available from the millage levy and any service charges the board may assess.  The board may
purchase, operate, and maintain vehicles for curbside or roadside solid waste collection.  In rural areas
where curbside collection services may not be economically feasible, the board may construct and
operate transfer stations for areawide collection and transfer of solid waste to ultimate disposal sites.

   C.  The board of county commissioners of a county in which the question has passed shall have the
power and duty to promulgate and adopt such rules, procedures and contract provisions necessary to
implement the purposes and objectives of this section.  The board of county commissioners shall have
the additional powers to hire a manager and appropriate personnel, contract, organize, maintain or
otherwise operate the solid waste management services within said county and such additional powers
as may be authorized by the Legislature.

   D.  Two or more counties in which the question has passed may enter into agreements with each
other to provide solid waste management services in all counties involved in the most economical
fashion, including agreements to provide collection and disposal services for each other where areas in
one county may be more economically served by facilities located in another county.

   E.  In addition to other powers provided for pursuant to the provisions of this section, the board of
county commissioners of any county in which the question has passed may issue bonds, if approved by
a majority vote at a special election for such purpose.  All registered voters within the county shall have
the right to vote in said election.  Such bonds may be issued for the purpose of:

   1.  acquiring vehicles, equipment and other necessary items;

   2.  purchasing landfill sites;

   3.  constructing landfills, transfer stations, or other facilities for solid waste management, disposal, and
recycling; and

for by law for the sale of county-owned property.

   F.   The bonds authorized, pursuant to the provisions for subsection E of this section shall not bear
interest at a greater rate than that authorized by statute for the issuance of city municipal bonds.  Such
bonds shall be sold only at public sale after twenty (20) days' advertisement in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county.  Any county may refund its bonds as is now provided by law for refunding
municipal bonds.  

   G.  Any board of county commissioners, upon issuing bonds as authorized in subsection E of this
section, shall levy a special annual ad valorem tax upon the property within the county, payable
annually, in a total amount not to exceed three (3) mills on the dollar, on the real and personal taxable
property in such county, for the payment of principal and interest on outstanding bonds, until same are
paid.  However, the board may suspend, from time to time, the collection of such annual levy when not
required for the payment of the bonds.

   H.  There may also be pledged to the payment of principal and interest of the bonds authorized to be
issued:

   1.  any net proceeds from operation of the county solid waste management services that the board of
county commissioners shall deem not necessary to the future operation, maintenance or closure of said
solid waste management services and facilities; or

   2.  any monies available from other funds of the county not otherwise obligated.

   I.  Bonds shall be issued for designated sums with interest payable semiannually and with the principal
maturing annually beginning not more than three (3) years from date of issue.  All bonds and interest
thereon shall be paid upon maturity and no bonds shall be issued for a period longer than thirty (30)
years.  Any board of county commissioners may in its discretion schedule the payment of principal over
the period of maturity of the bond issue, so that when interest is added there will be approximately level
annual payments of principal and interest.

   J.  In the event the mill levy as provided for in the original election proclamation is less than three (3)
mills, the board of county commissioners may call a subsequent election to consider increasing the mill
levy; provided, however, the total levy authorized by subsection A of this section shall not exceed three
(3) mills.

issued by the county pursuant to the provisions hereof, and shall be responsible for the economical
expenditure of the funds derived from the bonds.

   L.  The board of county commissioners shall be empowered to charge fees for services, and accept
gifts, funds or grants from sources other than the mill levy, which shall be used and accounted for in a
like manner.  Persons served outside the county shall be charged an amount equal to the actual costs
for providing the service, not taking into account any income the county receives from millage or
sources within the county.  The board shall have legal authority to bring such suits necessary to collect
accounts owed and to sue and defend as necessary for the protection of the board.  The State Auditor
and Inspector shall conduct an annual audit of the solid waste management operations of such counties.

   M.  Any county may cease providing solid waste management services, or cause the millage levy
authorized by subsection G of this section to be changed, by a majority vote of the registered voters
voting at an election called for that purpose by the board of county commissioners.  Such an election
shall not be called unless either two-thirds ( ) of the board members vote to call such an election, or
the board is presented a petition signed by not less than twenty percent (20%) of all registered voters in
the county.

   N.  If a county ceases to provide solid waste management services, any mill levy used to support,
organize, operate and maintain the services and facilities shall cease, provided that such mill levy shall
not cease until all outstanding solid waste management services bonds of that county are retired, all
other debts incurred by the county in providing solid waste management services have been satisfied,
and all facilities have been properly closed as provided for by law.

   O.  All elections called pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be conducted by the county
election board of each county involved, upon receipt of an election proclamation, issued by the board
of county commissioners in the county affected.  Said proclamation shall be published in one issue of a
newspaper of general circulation in the county at lease ten (10) days prior to said election.  The
proclamation shall set forth the purpose of the election to the board issuing the proclamation.

24 and 25 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma.

   To ensure a balanced annual budget, pursuant to the limitations contained in the foregoing,
procedures are herewith established as follows:

   1.  Not more than forty-five (45) days or less than thirty-five (35) days prior to the convening of each
regular session of the Legislature, the State Board of Equalization shall certify the total amount of
revenue which accrued during the last preceding fiscal year to the General Revenue Fund and to each
Special Revenue Fund appropriated directly by the Legislature, and shall further certify amounts
available for appropriation which shall be based on a determination, in accordance with the procedure
hereinafter provided, of the revenues to be received by the state under the laws in effect at the time
such determination is made, for the next ensuing fiscal year, showing separately the revenues to accrue
to the credit of each such fund of the state appropriated directly by the Legislature.

   Amounts certified as available for appropriation from each fund, as hereinbefore provided, shall be
ninety-five percent (95%) of an itemized estimate made by the State Board of Equalization, which shall
include all sources of revenue to each fund for the next ensuing fiscal year; provided, however,
appropriated federal funds shall be certified for the full amount of the estimate.  Said estimate shall
consider any increase or decline in revenues that would result from predictable changes in the economy.

   Legislative appropriations for any fiscal year, except for special appropriations provided for in
paragraph 4, shall be limited to a sum not to exceed the total amount appropriated from all funds in the
preceding fiscal year, plus twelve percent (12%), adjusted for inflation for the previous calendar year. 
Said limit shall be adjusted for funds not previously appropriated.  The limit on the growth of
appropriations shall be certified to by the State Board of Equalization.

   2.  Such certification shall be filed with the Governor, the President and President Pro Tempore of the
Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  The Legislature shall not pass or enact any
bill, act or measure making an appropriation of money for any purpose until such certification is made
and filed, unless the State Board of Equalization has failed to file said certification at the time of
convening of said Legislature.  In such event, it shall be the duty of the Legislature to make such
certification pursuant to the provisions of this section.  All appropriations made in excess of such
certification shall be null and void; provided, however, that the Legislature may at any regular session or
special session, called for that purpose, enact laws to provide for additional revenues or a reduction in
revenues, other than ad valorem taxes,
or transferring the existing revenues or unappropriated cash on hand from one fund to another, or
making provisions for appropriating funds not previously appropriated directly by the Legislature. 
Whereupon, it shall be the duty of the State Board of Equalization to make a determination of the
revenues that will accrue under such laws and ninety-five percent (95%) of the amount of any increase
or decrease resulting, for any reason, from such changes in laws shall be added to or deducted from the
amount previously certified available for appropriation from each respective fund, as the case may be.  
The State Board of Equalization shall file the amount of such adjusted certification, or additional
certification for funds not previously appropriated directly by the Legislature, with the Governor, with
the President and President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and such adjusted amount shall be the maximum amount which can be appropriated
for all purposes from any such fund for the fiscal year being certified.

   3.  The State Board of Equalization shall meet within five (5) days after the monthly apportionment in
February of each year, and at that time may adjust the certification, based upon the most current
information available, and determine the amount of funds available for appropriation for that legislative
session.  At said meeting the Board shall determine the limit on the growth of appropriations as
provided for in this section.

   4.  Surplus funds or monies shall be any amount accruing to the General Revenue Fund of the State of
Oklahoma over and above the itemized estimate made by the State Board of Equalization.

   Beginning July l, 1985, all such surplus funds or monies accruing after said date shall be placed in a
Constitutional Reserve Fund by the State Treasurer until such time that the amount of said Fund equals
ten percent (10%) of the General Revenue Fund certification for the preceding fiscal year. 
Appropriations made from said Fund shall be considered special appropriations.

   Up to one-half () of the balance at the beginning of the current fiscal year in the said Fund may be
appropriated for the forthcoming fiscal year, when the certification by the State Board of Equalization
for said forthcoming fiscal year General Revenue Fund is less than that of the current fiscal year
certification.  In no event shall the amount of monies appropriated from said Reserve Fund be in excess
of the difference between the two said certifications.

   Up to one-half () of the balance at the beginning of the current fiscal year in the said Fund may be
appropriated, upon a declaration by the Governor that emergency conditions exist, with concurrence of
the Legislature by a two-thirds ( ) vote of the House of Representatives and Senate for the
appropriation; or said one-half () could be appropriated upon a joint declaration of emergency
conditions by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the
Senate, with a concurrence of a three-fourths ( ) vote of the House of Representatives and Senate.

   5.  That portion of every appropriation, at the end of each fiscal year, in excess of actual revenues
collected and allocated thereto, as hereinafter provided, shall be null and void.  Revenues deposited in
the State Treasury to the credit of the General Revenue Fund or of any special fund (which derives its
revenue in whole or in part from state taxes or fees) shall, except as to principal and interest on the
public debt, be allocated monthly to each department, institution, board, commission or special
appropriation on a percentage basis, in that ratio that the total appropriation for such department,
institution, board, commission or special appropriation from each fund for that fiscal year bears to the
total of all appropriations from each fund for that fiscal year, and no warrant shall be issued in excess of
said allocation.  Any department, institution or agency of the state operating on revenues derived from
any law or laws which allocate the revenues thereof to such department, institution or agency shall not
incur obligations
in excess of the unencumbered balance of cash on hand.  Nothing in this section shall prevent, under
such conditions and limitations as shall be prescribed by law, the governing board of an institution of
higher education with The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education from contracting with a
president of such institution of higher education for periods extending more than one (1) year, but not to
exceed three (3) years beyond the fiscal year in which the contract is signed.

   6.  The Legislature shall provide a method whereby appropriations shall be divided and set up on a
monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis within each fiscal year to prevent obligations being incurred in
excess of the revenue to be collected, and notwithstanding other provisions of this Constitution, the
Legislature shall provide that all appropriations shall be reduced to bring them within revenues actually
collected, but all such reductions shall apply to each department, institution, board, commission or
special appropriation made by the State Legislature in the ratio that its total appropriation for that fiscal
year bears to the total of all appropriations from that fund for that fiscal year; provided, however, that
the Governor may in his discretion issue deficiency certificates to the State Treasurer for the benefit of
any department, institution or agency of the state, if the amount of such deficiency certificates be within
the limit of the current appropriation for that department, institution or agency, whereupon the State
Treasurer shall issue warrants to the extent of such certificates for the payment of such claims as may be
authorized by the Governor, and such warrants shall become a part of the public debt and shall be paid
out of any money appropriated by the Legislature and made lawfully available therefor; provided
further, that in no event shall said deficiency certificates exceed in the aggregate the sum of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.0) in any fiscal year.
