               CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA-1776

*** ASTART 9001.0 PA 1776 ***

WHEREAS all government ought to be instituted and supported for the security and protection
of the community as such, and to enable the individuals who compose it to enjoy their natural
rights, and the other blessings which the Author of existence has bestowed upon man; and
whenever these great ends of government are not obtained, the people have a right, by common
consent to change it, and take such measures as to them may appear necessary to promote their
safety and happiness. AND WHEREAS the inhabitants of this commonwealth have in
consideration of protection only, heretofore acknowledged allegiance to the king of Great Britain;
and the said king has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced, and still continues to
carry on, with unabated vengeance, a most cruel and unjust war against them, employing therein,
not only the troops of Great Britain, but foreign mercenaries, savages and slaves, for the avowed
purpose of reducing them to a total and abject submission to the despotic domination of the
British parliament, with many other acts of tyranny, (more fully set forth in the declaration of
Congress) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the said king and his successors, are dissolved and
at an end, and all power and authority derived from him ceased in these colonies. AND
WHEREAS it is absolutely necessary for the welfare and safety of the inhabitants of said colo-

nies, that they be henceforth free and independent States, and that just, permanent, and proper
forms of government exist in every part of them, derived from and founded on the authority of
the people only, agreeable to the directions of the honourable American Congress. We, the
representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania, in general convention met, for the express
purpose of framing such a government, confessing the goodness of the great Governor of the
universe (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happiness mankind may attain, by
perfecting the arts of government) in permitting the people of this State, by common consent, and
without violence, deliberately to form for themselves such just rules as they shall think best, for
governing their future society; and being fully convinced, that it is our indispensable duty to
establish such original principles of government, as will best promote the general happiness of
the people of this State, and their posterity, and provide for future improvements, without
partiality for, or prejudice against any particular class, sect, or denomination of men whatever,
do, by virtue of the authority vested in use by our constituents, ordain, declare, and establish, the
following Declaration of Rights and Frame of Government, to be the CONSTITUTION of this
commonwealth, and to remain in force therein for ever, unaltered, except in such articles as shall
hereafter on experience be found to require improvement, and which shall by the same authority
of the people, fairly delegated as this frame of government directs, be amended or improved for
the more effectual obtaining and securing the great end and design of all government, herein
before mentioned.

acknowledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on
account of his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship: And that no authority
can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere

V. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection and security
of the people, nation or community and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any
single man, family, or sett of men, who are a part only of that community; And that community
hath an indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish government in
such manner as shall be by that community judged most conducive to the public weal.

protection, and yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent thereto: But no part of
a man's property can be justly taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own
consent, or that of his legal representatives: Nor can any man who is conscientiously scrupulous
of bearing arms, be justly compelled thereto, if he wilt pay such equivalent, nor are the people
bound by any laws, but such as they have in like manner assented to, for their common good.

country, without the unanimous consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty; nor can he be
compelled to give evidence against himself; nor can any man be justly deprived of his liberty
except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 010.0 001.0 0 PA 1776 ***

X. That the people have a right to hold themselves, their houses, papers, and possessions free
from search and seizure, and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations first made,
affording a sufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be
commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons, his or their
property not articularly described, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.

*** SSTART 013.0 001.0 0 PA 1776 ***

XIII. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as
standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And
that the military should be kept under-strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 014.0 001.0 0 PA 1776 ***

XIV. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles, and a firm adherence to justice,
moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings

these points in the choice of officers and representatives, and have a right to exact a due and
constant regard to them, from their legislatures and magistrates, in the making and executing
such laws as are necessary for the good government of the state.

SECT. 36. As every freeman to preserve his independence, (if without a sufficient estate) ought
to have some profession, calling, trade or farm, whereby he may honestly subsist, there can be no
necessity for, nor use in establishing offices of profit, the usual effects of which are dependence
and servility unbecoming freemen, in the possessors and expectants; faction, contention,
corruption, and disorder among the people.  But if any man is called into public service, to the
prejudice of his  private affairs, he has a right to a reasonable compensation: And whenever an
office, through increase of fees or otherwise, becomes so profitable as to occasion many to apply
for it, the profits ought to be lessened by the legislature.
