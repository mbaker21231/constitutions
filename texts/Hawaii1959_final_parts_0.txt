  SEC. 4.  REAPPORTIONMENT Of HOUSE.  On or before June 1 of the year 1959, and
  of each tenth year thereafter, the governor shall reapportion the members of the house of
  representatives in the following manner: The total number of representatives shall first be
  reapportioned among four basic areas, namely, (1) the island of Hawaii, (2) the islands of
  Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe, (3) the island of Oahu and all other islands not
  specifically enumerated, and (4) the islands of Kauai and Niihau, on the basis of the
  number of voters registered at the last preceding general election in each of such basic       
  areas and computed by the method known as the method of equal proportions, no basic
  area to receive less than one member. Upon the determination of the total number of
  representatives to which each basic area is entitled, such total shall be reapportioned
  among the one or more representative districts within each basic area on the basis of the
  number of voters registered at the last preceding general election within each of such
  representative districts and computed by the method known as the method of equal
  proportions, no representative district to receive less than one member. Upon any
  reapportionment, should the total number of voters registered in any representative district
  be less than one-half of the quotient obtained by dividing the total number of voters
  registered in the State by the total number of members to which the house is entitled, then,
  as part of such reapportionment, the basic area within which such representative district
  lies shall be redistricted by the governor in such manner that the total number of voters
  registered in each new representative district therein shall be more than one-half of such
  quotient.
       The governor shall thereupon issue a proclamation showing the results of such
  reapportionment, and such reapportionment shall be effective for the election of members
  to such house for the next five succeeding legislatures.
           
  MANDAMUS.  Original jurisdiction is hereby vested in the supreme court of the State to
  be exercised on the application of any registered voter, made within thirty days following
  the date specified above, to compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the governor to perform
  the above duty; and made within thirty days following the date of such proclamation, to
  compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the correction of any error made in such
  reapportionment.

  passed, only one reading being required in each house for such passage, it shall be
  presented again to the governor, but shall become law only if he shall sign it within ten
  days after presentation.  Sundays and holidays shall be excluded in computing the number

       Sixty million dollars is established as the limit of the funded debt of the State at any

  such limit may be issued when authorized by a two-thirds vote of all the members to which
  each house of the legislature is entitled, provided such excess debt, at the time of
  authorization, would not cause the total of state indebtedness to exceed a sum equal to
  fifteen percent of the total of assessed values for tax rate purposes of real property in the
  State, as determined by the last tax assessment rolls  pursuant to law.
       Instruments of indebtedness to meet appropriations for any fiscal period in anticipation
  of the collection of revenues for such period or to meet casual deficits or failures of
  revenue, which shall be payable within one year, and bonds or other instruments of
  indebtedness to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, to defend the State in war or to

  at any time outstanding and unpaid. The aggregate, however, of such debts contracted by
  any political subdivision during a fiscal year shall not exceed two percent of the total of
  such assessed values in such political subdivision.
       Instruments of indebtedness to meet appropriations for any fiscal period in anticipation
  of the collection of revenues for such period or to meet casual deficits or failures of
  revenue, which shall be payable within one year, may be issued by any political subdivision
  under authorization of law and of its governing body, without regard to the limits of debt
  hereinabove provided.
       All bonds or other instruments of indebtedness for a term exceeding one year shall be
  in serial form maturing in substantially equal annual installments, the first installment to
  mature not later than five years from the date of the issue of such series, and the last
  installment not later than thirty-five years from the date of such issue. Interest and
  principal payments shall be a first charge on the general revenues of the State or political
  subdivision, as the case may be.
       The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to indebtedness incurred under
  revenue bond statutes by a public enterprise of the State or political subdivision, or by a
  public corporation, when the only security for such indebtedness is the revenues of such
  enterprise or public corporation, or to indebtedness incurred under special improvement
  statutes when the only security for such indebtedness is the properties benefited or
