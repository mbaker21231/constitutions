  the 
  State, at its regular session in the year 1874, is hereby declared to create a valid contract     
  between the State and each and every holder of said bonds, which the State shall by no means    
  
  and in no wise impair. The said bonds shall be a valid obligation of the State in favor of any     
  holder thereof, and no court shall enjoin the payment of the principal or interest thereof, or the   
  
  levy and collection of the tax therefor; to secure such levy, collection, and payment the     
  judicial power shall be exercised when necessary. The tax required for the payment of the     
  principal and interest of said bonds shall be assessed and collected each and every year until     
  the bonds shall be paid, principal and interest, and the proceeds shall be paid by the treasurer     
  
  of the State to the holders of said bonds as the principal and interest of the same shall fall due,   
   and no further legislation or appropriation shall be requisite for the said assessment and     
  collection and for such payment from the treasury.
  
   SEC. 2. Whenever the debt of the State shall have been reduced below twenty-five million     
  dollars, the constitutional limit shall remain at the lowest point reached, beyond which the     
  public debt shall not thereafter be increased; and this rule continue in operation until the debt     
  is reduced to fifteen million dollars, beyond which it shall not be increased. Nor shall taxation   
   
  for all State purposes, excepting the support of public schools, ever exceed twelve and a half     
  mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the real and personal property in the State,     
  except in case of war or invasion.
  
   SEC. 3. The revenue of each year derived from taxation upon real, personal, and mixed

  shall be raised, excepting any surplus remain, which shall be directed to sinking the public     
  debt. All appropriations and claims in excess of revenue shall be null and void, and the State
