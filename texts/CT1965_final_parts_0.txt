ARTICLE XXVI.

Section 2 of article sixteen of the amendments to the constitution is amended to read as follows:

a. The assembly and senatorial districts and congressional districts as now established by law shall
continue until the regular session of the general assembly next after the completion of the taking of the
next census of the United States. On or before the fifteenth day of February next following the year in
which the decennial census of the United States is taken, the general assembly shall appoint a
reapportionment committee consisting of four members of the senate, two who shall be designated by
the president pro tempore of the senate and two who shall be designated by the minority leader of the
senate, and four members of the house of representatives, two who shall be designated by the speaker
of the house of representatives and two who shall be designated by the minority leader of the house of
representatives, provided there are members of no more than two political parties in either the senate or
the house of representatives. In the event that there are members of more than two political parties in a
house of the general assembly, all members of that house belonging to the parties other than that of the
president pro tempore of the senate or the speaker of the house of representatives, as the case may be,
shall select one of their number, who shall designate two members of the committee in lieu of the
designation by the minority leader of that house. Such committee shall advise the general assembly on
matters of apportionment. Upon the filing of a report of such committee with the clerk of the house of
representatives and the clerk of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the
president pro tempore of the senate shall, if the general assembly is not in regular session, convene the
general assembly in special session for the sole purpose of adopting a plan of districting. Upon the
request of the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate, the
secretary of the state shall give notice of such special session by mailing a true copy of the call of such
special session, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to each member of the house of
representatives and of the senate at his or her address as it appears upon the records of said secretary
not less than ten nor more than fifteen days prior to the date of convening of such special session or by
causing a true copy of the call to be delivered to each member by a sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable,
state policeman or indifferent person at least twenty-four hours prior to the time of convening of such
special session. Such general assembly shall, upon roll call, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the
membership of each house, adopt such plan of districting as is necessary to preserve a proper
apportionment of representation in accordance with the principles recited in this article. Thereafter the
general assembly shall decennially at its next regular session or special session called for the purpose of
adopting a plan of districting following the completion of the taking of the census of the United States,
upon roll call, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house, adopt such plan of
districting as is necessary in accordance with the provisions of this article.

b. If the general assembly fails to adopt a plan of districting by the fifteenth day of the September next
following the year in which the decennial census of the United States is taken, the governor shall
forthwith appoint a commission designated by the president pro tempore of the senate, the speaker of
the house of representatives, the minority leader of the senate and the minority leader of the house of
representatives, each of whom shall designate two members of the commission, provided that there are
members of no more than two political parties in either the senate or the house of representatives. In the
event that there are members of more than two political parties in a house of the general assembly, all
members of that house belonging to the parties other than that of the president pro tempore of the
senate or the speaker of the house of representatives, as the case may be, shall select one of their
number, who shall designate two members of the commission in lieu of the designation by the minority
leader of that house. The eight members of the commission so designated shall within thirty days select
an elector of the state as a ninth member.

c. The commission shall proceed to consider the alteration of districts in accordance with the principles
recited in this article and it shall submit a plan of districting to the secretary of the state by the thirtieth
day of the November next succeeding the appointment of its members. No plan shall be submitted to
the secretary unless it is certified by at least five members of the commission. Upon receiving such plan
the secretary shall publish the same forthwith, and, upon publication, such plan of districting shall have
the full force of law. If the commission shall fail to submit such a plan by the thirtieth day of November,
the secretary of the state shall forthwith so notify the chief justice of the supreme court.

d. Original jurisdiction is vested in the supreme court to be exercised on the petition of any registered
voter whereby said court may compel the commission, by mandamus or otherwise, to perform its duty
or to correct any error made in its plan of districting, or said court may take such other action to
effectuate the purposes of this article, including the establishing of a plan of districting if the commission
fails to file its plan of districting by the thirtieth day of November as said court may deem appropriate.
Any such petition shall be filed within thirty days of the date specified for any duty or within thirty days
after the filing of a plan of districting. The supreme court shall render its decision not later than forty-five
days following the filing of such petition or shall file its plan with the secretary of the state not later than

commission. Upon receiving such plan the secretary shall publish the same forthwith, and, upon
publication, such plan of districting shall have the full force of the law.

year above the amount of general budget expenditures authorized for the previous fiscal year by a
percentage which exceeds the greater of the percentage increase in personal income or the percentage
increase in inflation, unless the governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary
circumstances and at least three-fifths of the members of each house of the general assembly vote to

assembly shall by law define "increase in personal income", "increase in inflation" and "general budget
expenditures" for the purposes of this section and may amend such definitions, from time to time,
provided general budget expenditures shall not include expenditures for the payment of bonds, notes or

of three-fifths of the members of each house of the general assembly.
