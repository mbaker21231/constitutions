the borrowing capacity of said city of Philadelphia, at any time, there shall be excluded from the
calculation a credit where the work resulting from any previous expenditure, for any one or more
of the specific purposes here above enumerated shall be yielding to said city an annual current
net revenue; the amount of which credit shall be ascertained by capitalizing the annual net
revenue during the year immediately preceding the time of such ascertainment. Such
capitalization shall be accomplished by ascertaining the principal amount which would yield such
annual current net revenue, at the average rate of interest, and sinking-fund charges payable upon
the indebtedness incurred by said city for such purposes, up to the time of such ascertainment.
The method of determining such amount, so to be excluded or allowed as a credit, may be

purposes of construction, improvement, or reclamation, the city of Philadelphia may issue its
obligations maturing not later than fifty years from the date thereof, with provision for a sinking-
fund sufficient to retire said obligation at maturity, the payments to such sinking-fund to be in
equal or graded annual instalments. Such obligations may be in an amount sufficient to provide
for and may include the amount of the interest and sinking-fund charges accruing and which may
accrue thereon throughout the period of construction and until the expiration of one year after the
completion of the work for which said indebtedness shall have been incurred; and said city shall
not be required to levy a tax to pay said interest and sinking-fund charges, as required by section
ten of article nine of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, until the expiration of said period of one
year after the completion of such work.

Section 8. The debt of any county, city, borough, township, school district, or other municipality
or incorporated district, except as provided herein, and in section fifteen of this article, shall
never exceed seven (7) per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein, but
the debt of the city of Philadelphia may be increased in such amount that the total city debt of
said city shall not exceed ten per centum (10) upon the assessed value of the taxable property
therein, nor shall any such municipality or district incur any new debt, or increase its
indebtedness to an amount exceeding two (2) per centum upon such assessed valuation of
property, without the consent of the electors thereof at a public election in such manner as shall
be provided by law. In ascertaining the borrowing capacity of the city of Philadelphia, at any
time, there shall be deducted from such debt so much of the debt of said city as shall have been
incurred, or is about to be incurred, and the proceeds thereof expended, or about to be expended,
upon any public improvement, or in the construction, purchase, or condemnation of any public
utility, or part thereof, or facility therefor, if such public improvement or public utility, or part
thereof, whether separately, or in connection with any other public improvement or public utility,
or part thereof, may reasonably be expected to yield revenue in excess of operating expenses
sufficient to pay the interest and sinking-fund charges thereon. The method of determining such
amount, so to be deducted, may be prescribed by the General Assembly. In incurring
indebtedness for any purpose the city of Philadelphia may issue its obligations maturing not later
than fifty (50) years from the date thereof, with provision for a sinking-fund sufficient to retire
said obligations at maturity, the payment to such sinking fund to be in equal or graded annual or
other periodical installments. Where any indebtedness shall be or shall have been incurred by
said city of Philadelphia for the purpose of the construction or improvements of public works or
utilities of any character, from which income or revenue is to be derived by said city, or for the
reclamation of land to be used in the construction of wharves or docks owned or to be owned by
said city, such obligations may be in an amount sufficient to provide for, and may include the
amount of, the interest and sinking-fund charges accruing and which may accrue thereon
throughout the period of construction, and until the expiration of one year after the completion of
the work for which said indebtedness shall have been incurred; and said city shall not be required
to levy a tax to pay said interest and sinking fund charges as required by section ten, article nine
of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, until the expiration of said period of one year after the
completion of said work.

purpose, real estate so charged shall be classified as urban, suburban and rural, and assessments
made in accordance with such classifications. 7. For the creation, by the board of commissioners,

limited in the charter. 2. The power to lay and collect taxes and to incur indebtedness, subject to
the limitations which are or may be imposed by law upon cities, boroughs or townships of
corresponding classification, for the purpose of carrying out any lawful power of said divisions.

thereof, provided that the total of the indebtedness of the consolidated city and the municipal
divisions thereof shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the limits of the total indebtedness allowed

specifically granted by the charter to the consolidated city: Provided, however, That a municipal
division may surrender, by majority vote of the electors voting thereon at any general or special
election, any of its powers to the consolidated city, subject to the acceptance thereof by the board
of commissioners. The said charter may be amended by the Legislature, subject to ratification by

Section 8. The debt of any county, city, borough, township, school district, or other municipality
or incorporated district, except as provided herein, and in section fifteen of this article, shall
never exceed seven (7) per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein, nor
shall any such county, municipality or district incur any debt, or increase its indebtedness to an
amount exceeding two (2) per centum upon such assessed valuation of property, without the
consent of the electors thereof at a public election in such manner as shall be provided by law.
The debt of the city of Philadelphia may be increased in such amount that the total debt of said
city shall not exceed thirteen and one-half (13 1/2) per centum of the average of the annual
assessed valuations of the taxable realty therein, during the ten years immediately preceding the

exceeding three (3) per centum upon such average assessed valuation of realty, without the
consent of the electors thereof at a public election held in such manner as shall be provided by

debt-incurring capacity of the city of Philadelphia at any time, there shall be deducted from the
debt of said city so much of such debt as shall have been incurred, or is about to be incurred, and
the proceeds thereof expended, or about to be expended, upon any public improvement, or in

if such public improvement or public utility, or part thereof, or facility therefor, whether
separately, or in connection with any other public improvement or public utility, or part thereof,
or facility therefor, may reasonably be expected to yield revenue in excess of operating expenses
sufficient to pay the interest and sinking fund charges thereon. The method of determining such
amount, so to be deducted, shall be as now prescribed, or which may hereafter be prescribed by
the General Assembly. In incurring indebtedness for any purpose the city of Philadelphia may
issue its obligations maturing not later than fifty (50) years from the date thereof, with provision
for a sinking fund to be in equal or graded annual or other periodical installments. Where any
indebtedness shall be or shall have been incurred by said city of Philadelphia for the purpose of
the construction or improvement of public works or utilities of any character, from which income
or revenue is to be derived by said city, or for the reclamation of land to be used in the
construction of wharves or docks owned or to be owned by said city, such obligations may be in
an amount sufficient to provide for, and may include the amount of, the interest and sinking fund
charges accruing and which may accrue thereon throughout the period of construction, and until
the expiration of one year after the completion of the work for which said indebtedness shall
have been incurred; and said city shall not be required to levy a tax to pay said interest and
