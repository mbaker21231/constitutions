Sec. 9. The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws,
called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the
referendum.  The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under
this constitution.  The power of referendum does not extend to acts making appropriations for
state institutions or to meet deficiencies in state funds and must be invoked in the manner
prescribed by law within 90 days following the final adjournment of the legislative session at
which the law was enacted.  To invoke the initiative or referendum, petitions signed by a number
of registered electors, not less than eight percent for initiative and five percent for referendum of
the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last preceding general election at which a
governor was elected shall be required.

No law as to which the power of referendum properly has been invoked shall be effective
thereafter unless approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at the next general
election.  

Any law proposed by initiative petition shall be either enacted or rejected by the legislature
without change or amendment within 40 session days from the time such petition is received by
the legislature.  If any law proposed by such petition shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be
subject to referendum, as hereinafter provided.

If the law so proposed is not enacted by the legislature within the 40 days, the state officer
authorized by law shall submit such proposed law to the people for approval or rejection at the
next general election.  The legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition
and propose a different measure upon the same subject by a yea and nay vote upon separate roll
calls, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by such state officer to the electors for
approval or rejection at the next general election.

Any law submitted to the people by either initiative or referendum petition and approved by a
majority of the votes cast thereon at any election shall take effect 10 days after the date of the
official declaration of the vote.  No law initiated or adopted by the people shall be subject to the
veto power of the governor, and no law adopted by the people at the polls under the initiative
provisions of this section shall be amended or repealed, except by a vote of the electors unless
otherwise provided in the initiative measure or by three-fourths of the members elected to and
serving in each house of the legislature.  Laws approved by the people under the referendum
provision of this section may be amended by the legislature at any subsequent session thereof.  If
two or more measures approved by the electors at the same election conflict, that receiving the
highest affirmative vote shall prevail.

The legislature shall implement the provisions of this section.

Sec. 1. The legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate and a house of
representatives.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 002.0 004.0 0 MI 1963 ***

Sec. 2. The senate shall consist of 38 members to be elected from single member districts at the
same election as the governor for four year terms concurrent with the term of office of the
governor.

In districting the state for the purpose of electing senators after the official publication of the total
population count of each federal decennial census, each county shall be assigned apportionment
factors equal to the sum of its percentage of the state's population as shown by the last regular
federal decennial census computed to the nearest one-one hundredth of one percent multiplied by
four and its percentage of the state's land area computed to the nearest one-one hundredth of one
percent.

In arranging the state into senatorial districts, the apportionment commission shall be governed
by the following rules:

(1) Counties with 13 or more apportionment factors shall be entitled as a class to senators in the
proportion that the total apportionment factors of such counties bear to the total apportionment
factors of the state computed to the nearest whole number. After each such county has been
allocated one senator, the remaining senators to which this class of counties is entitled shall be
distributed among such counties by the method of equal proportions applied to the apportionment
factors.

(2) Counties having less than 13 apportionment factors shall be entitled as a class to senators in
the proportion that the total apportionment factors of such counties bear to the total
apportionment factors of the state computed to the nearest whole number. Such counties shall
thereafter be arranged into senatorial districts that are compact, convenient, and contiguous by
land, as rectangular in shape as possible, and having as nearly as possible 13 apportionment
factors, but in no event less than 10 or more than 16. Insofar as possible, existing senatorial
districts at the time of reapportionment shall not be altered unless there is a failure to comply
with the above standards.

(3) Counties entitled to two or more senators shall be divided into single member districts. The
population of such districts shall be as nearly equal as possible but shall not be less than 75
percent nor more than 125 percent of a number determined by dividing the population of the
county by the number of senators to which it is entitled. Each such district shall follow
incorporated city or township boundary lines to the extent possible and shall be compact,
contiguous, and as nearly uniform in shape as possible.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 003.0 004.0 0 MI 1963 ***

Sec. 3. The house of representatives shall consist of 110 members elected for two-year terms
from single member districts apportioned on a basis of population as provided in this article. The
districts shall consist of compact and convenient territory contiguous by land.

Each county which has a population of not less than seven-tenths of one percent of the-
population of the state shall constitute a separate representative area. Each county having less
than seven-tenths of one percent of the population of the state shall be combined with another
county or counties to form a representative area of not less than seven-tenths of one percent of
the population of the state. Any county which is isolated under the initial allocation as provided
in this section shall be joined with that contiguous representative area having the smallest
percentage of the state's population. Each such representative area shall be entitled initially to one
representative.

After the assignment of one representative to each of the representative areas, the remaining
house seats shall be apportioned among the representative areas on the basis of population by the
method of equal proportions.

Any county comprising a representative area entitled to two or more representatives shall be
divided into single member representative districts as follows:

(1) The population of such districts shall be as nearly equal as possible but shall not be less than
75 percent nor more than 125 percent of a number determined by dividing the population of the
representative area by the number of representatives to which it is entitled.

(2) Such single member districts shall follow city and township boundaries where applicable and
shall be composed of compact and contiguous territory as nearly square in shape as possible.

Any representative area consisting of more than one county, entitled to more than one
representative, shall be divided into single member districts as equal as possible in population,
adhering to county lines

same county annexed to or merged with a city between apportionments shall become a part of a
contiguous representative or senatorial district in the city with which it is combined, if provided
by ordinance of the city. The district or districts with which the territory shall be combined shall
be determined by such ordinance certified to the secretary of state. No such change in the
boundaries of a representative or senatorial district shall have the effect of removing a legislator
from office during his term.

Sec. 6. A commission on legislative apportionment is hereby established consisting of eight
electors, four of whom shall be selected by the state organizations of each of the two political
parties whose candidates for governor received the highest vote at the last general election at
which a governor was elected preceding each apportionment. If a candidate for governor of a
third political party has received at such election more than 25 percent of such gubernatorial vote,
the commission shall consist of 12 members, four of whom shall be selected by the state
organization of the third political party. One resident of each of the following four regions shall
be selected by each political party organization: (1) the upper peninsula; (2) the northern part of
the lower peninsula, north of a line drawn along the northern boundaries of the counties of Bay,
Midland, Isabella, Mecosta, Newaygo and Oceana; (3) southwestern Michigan, those counties
south of region (2) and west of a line drawn along the western boundaries of the counties of Bay,
Saginaw, Shiawassee, Ingham, Jackson and Hillsdale; (4) southeastern Michigan, the remaining
counties of the state.

No officers or employees of the federal, state or local governments, excepting notaries public and
members of the armed forces reserve, shall be eligible for membership on the commission.
Members of the commission shall not be eligible for election to the legislature until two years
after the apportionment in which they participated becomes effective.

The commission shall be appointed immediately after the adoption of this constitution and
whenever apportionment or districting of the legislature is required by the provisions of this
constitution. Members of the commission shall hold office until each apportionment or districting
plan becomes effective. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as for original appointment.

The secretary of state shall be secretary of the commission without vote, and in that capacity shall
furnish, under the direction of the commission, all necessary technical services. The commission
shall elect its own chairman, shall make its own rules of procedure, and shall receive
compensation provided by law. The legislature shall appropriate funds to enable the commission
to carry out its activities.

Within 30 days after the adoption of this constitution, and after the official total population count
of each federal decennial census of the state and its political subdivisions is available, the
secretary of state shall issue a call convening the commission not less than 30 nor more than 45
days thereafter. The commission shall complete its work within 180 days after all necessary
census information is available. The commission shall proceed to district and apportion the
senate and house of representatives according to the provisions of this constitution. All final
decisions shall require the concurrence of a majority of the members of the commission. The
commission shall hold public hearings as may be provided by law. 

Each final apportionment and districting plan shall be published as provided by law within 30
days from the date of its adoption and shall become law 60 days after publication. The secretary
of state shall keep a public record of all the proceedings of the commission and shall be
responsible for the publication and distribution of each plan.

If a majority of the commission cannot agree on a plan, each member of the commission,
individually or jointly with other members, may submit a proposed plan to the supreme court.
The supreme court shall determine which plan complies most accurately with the constitutional
requirements and shall direct that it be adopted by the commission and published as provided in
this section.

Upon the application of any elector filed not later than 60 days after final publication of the plan,
the supreme court, in the exercise of original jurisdiction, shall direct the secretary of state or the
commission to perform their duties, may review any final plan adopted by the commission, and
shall remand such plan to the commission for further action if it fails to comply with the
requirements of this constitution.

If the minimum amount which would otherwise be necessary for a school district to levy in any
year to pay principal and interest on its qualified bonds, including any necessary allowances for
estimated tax delinquencies, exceeds 13 mills on each dollar of its assessed valuation as finally
equalized, or such lower millage as the legislature may prescribe, then the school district may
elect to borrow all or any part of the excess from the state. In that event the state shall lend the
excess amount to the school district for the payment of principal and interest. If for any reason
any school district will be or is unable to pay the principal and interest on its qualified bonds
when due, then the school district shall borrow and the state shall lend to it an amount sufficient
to enable the school district to make the payment.

The term "qualified bonds" means general obligation bonds of school districts issued for capital
expenditures, including refunding bonds, issued prior to May 4, 1955, or issued thereafter and
qualified as provided by law pursuant to Section 27 or Section 28 of Article X of the Constitution
of 1908 or pursuant to this section.

After a school district has received loans from the state, each year thereafter it shall levy for debt
service, exclusive of levies for nonqualified bonds, not less than 13 mills or such  lower millage
as the legislature may prescribe, until the amount loaned has been repaid, and any tax collections
therefrom in any year over and above the minimum requirements for principal and interest on
qualified bonds shall be used toward the repayment of state loans. In any year when such levy
would produce an amount in excess of the requirements and the amount due to the state, the levy
may be reduced by the amount of the excess.

Subject to the foregoing provisions, the legislature shall have the power to prescribe and to limit
the procedure, terms and conditions for the qualification of bonds, for obtaining and making state
loans, and for the repayment of loans.

The power to tax for the payment of principal and interest on bonds hereafter issued which are
the general obligations of any school district, including refunding bonds, and for repayment of
any state loans made to school districts, shall be without limitation as to rate or amount.

All rights acquired under Sections 27 and 28 of Article X of the Constitution of 1908, by holders
