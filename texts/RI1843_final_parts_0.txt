temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend to beget habits of hypocrisy

this country and their settlement of this state, was, as they expressed it, to hold forth a lively
experiment, that a flourishing civil state may stand and be best maintained with full liberty in
religious concernments; we, therefore, declare that no man shall be compelled to frequent or to
support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatever, except in fulfillment of his own
voluntary contract; nor enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods; nor
disqualified from holding any office; nor otherwise suffer on account of his religious belief; and
that every man shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and
by argument to maintain his opinion in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise
diminish, enlarge, or affect his civil capacity.
