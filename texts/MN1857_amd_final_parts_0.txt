  not pertaining or applicable to the portion of the road by them constructed, and a fee
  simple to which has not accrued to either of said companies, by reason of such
  construction, which was granted to the company or companies, thus failing to comply

  by three-fifths of the qualified voters of such city or village voting at the next election,
  and not otherwise: but such charter shall always be in harmony with and subject to the
  constitution and laws of the state of Minnesota. The legislature may prescribe the duties
  of the commission relative to submitting amendments of charter to the vote of the people.

  if of two houses at least one of them shall be elected by general vote of the citizens.
                 In submitting any such charter or amendment thereto to the qualified voters of

  SEC. 36. Any city or village in this state may frame a charter for its own government as a
  city consistent with and subject to the laws of this state, as follows: The legislature shall
  provide, under such restrictions as it deems proper, for a board of fifteen freeholders who
  shall be and for the past five years shall have been qualified voters thereof, to be
  appointed by the district judges of the judicial district in which the city or village is
  situated, as the legislature may determine, for a term in no event to exceed six years,
  which board shall, within six months after its appointment, return to the chief magistrate
  of said city or village a draft of said charter, signed by the members of said board, or a
  majority thereof. Such charter shall be submitted to the qualified voters of such city or
  village at the next election thereafter, and if four-sevenths of the qualified voters voting at
  such election shall ratify the same it shall, at the end of thirty days thereafter, become the
  charter of such city or village as a city, and supersede any existing charter and
  amendments thereof; provided, that in cities having patrol limits now established, such
  charter shall require a three-fourths majority vote of the qualified voters voting at such
  election to change the patrol limits now established.
             Before any city shall incorporate under this act the legislature shall prescribe by
  law the general limits within which such charter shall be framed. Duplicate certificates
  shall be made setting forth the charter proposed and its ratification, which shall be signed
  by the chief magistrate of said city or village and authenticated by its corporate seal. One
  of said certificates shall be deposited in the office of secretary of state, and the other, after
  being recorded in the office of the register of deeds for the county in which such city or
  village lies, shall be deposited among the achieves of such city or village, and all courts
  shall take judicial notice thereof. Such charter so deposited may be amended by proposal
  therefor made by a board of fifteen commissioners aforesaid, published for at least thirty
  days in three newspapers of general circulation in such city or village, and accepted by
  three-fifths of the qualified voters of such city or village voting at the next election and
  not otherwise; but such charter shall always be in harmony with and subject to the
  constitution and laws of the state of Minnesota. The legislature may prescribe the duties
  of the commission relative to submitting amendments of charter to the vote of the people,
  and shall provide that upon application of five per cent. of the legal voters of any such
  city or village, by written petition, such commission shall submit to the vote of the people
  proposed amendments to such charter set forth in said petition. The board of freeholders
  above provided for shall be permanent, and all the vacancies by death, disability to
  perform duties, resignation or removal from the corporate limits, or expiration of term of
  office, shall he filled by appointment in the same manner as the original board was
  created, and said board shall always contain its full complement of members.  It shall be a
  feature of all such charters that there shall be provided, among other things, for a mayor
  or chief magistrate, and a legislative body of either one or two houses; if of two houses, at
  least one of them shall be elected by general vote of the electors.
             In submitting any such charter or amendment thereto to the qualified voters of such
  city or village any alternate section or article may be presented for the choice of the voters
  and may be voted on separately without prejudice to other articles or sections of the
  charter or any amendments thereto.
             The legislature may provide general laws relating to affairs of cities, the
  application of which may be limited to cities of over fifty thousand inhabitants, or to
  cities of fifty and not less than twenty thousand inhabitants, or to cities of twenty and not
  less than ten thousand inhabitants, or to cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less, which
  shall apply equally to all such cities of either class, and which shall be paramount while in
  force to the provisions relating to the same matter included in the local charter herein
  provided for. But no local charter, provision or ordinance passed thereunder shall
  supersede any general law of the state defining or punishing crimes or misdemeanors.

  SEC. 36. Any city or village in this state may frame a charter for its own government as a
  city consistent with and subject to the laws of this state, as follows: The legislature shall
  provide, under such restrictions as it deems proper, for a board of fifteen freeholders who 
  shall be and for the past five years shall have been qualified voters thereof, to be
  appointed by the district judges of the judicial district in which the city or village is
  situated, as the legislature may determine, for a term in no event to exceed six years,
  which board shall, within six months after its appointment, return to the chief magistrate
  of said city or village a draft of said charter, signed by the members of said board, or a
  majority thereof. Such charter shall be submitted to the qualified voters of such city or
  village at the next election thereafter, and if four-sevenths of the qualified voters voting at
  such election shall ratify the same it shall, at the end of thirty days thereafter, become the
  charter of such city or village as a city, and supersede any existing charter and
  amendments thereof; provided, that in cities having patrol limits now established, such
  charter shall require a three-fourths majority vote of the qualified voters voting at such
  election to change the patrol limits now established.
             Before any city shall incorporate under this act the legislature shall prescribe by
  law the general limits within which such charter shall be framed. Duplicate certificates
  shall be made setting forth the charter proposed and its ratification, which shall be signed
  by the chief magistrate of said city or village and authenticated by its corporate seal. One
  of said certificates shall be deposited in the office of secretary of state, and the other, after
  being recorded in the office of the register of deeds for the county in which such city or
  village lies, shall be deposited among the achieves of such city or village, and all courts
  shall take judicial notice thereof. Such charter so deposited may be amended by proposal
  therefor made by a board of fifteen commissioners aforesaid, published for at least once
  each week for four successive weeks in a legal newspaper of general circulation in such
  city or village, and accepted by three-fifths of the qualified voters of such city or village
  voting at the next election and not otherwise; but such charter shall always be in harmony
  with and subject to the constitution and laws of the state of Minnesota. The legislature
  may prescribe the duties of the commission relative to submitting amendments of charter
  to the vote of the people, and shall provide that upon application of five per cent. of the
  legal voters of any such city or village, by written petition, such commission shall submit
  to the vote of the people proposed amendments to such charter set forth in said petition.
  The board of freeholders above provided for shall be permanent, and all the vacancies by
  death, disability to perform duties, resignation or removal from the corporate limits, or
  expiration of term of office, shall he filled by appointment in the same manner as the
  original board was created, and said board shall always contain its full complement of
  members.  It shall be a feature of all such charters that there shall be provided, among
  other things, for a mayor or chief magistrate, and a legislative body of either one or two
  houses; if of two houses, at least one of them shall be elected by general vote of the
  electors.
             In submitting any such charter or amendment thereto to the qualified voters of such
  city or village any alternate section or article may be presented for the choice of the voters
  and may be voted on separately without prejudice to other articles or sections of the
  charter or any amendments thereto.
             The legislature may provide general laws relating to affairs of cities, the
  application of which may be limited to cities of over fifty thousand inhabitants, or to
  cities of fifty and not less than twenty thousand inhabitants, or to cities of twenty and not
  less than ten thousand inhabitants, or to cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less, which
  shall apply equally to all such cities of either class, and which shall be paramount while in
  force to the provisions relating to the same matter included in the local charter herein
  provided for. But no local charter, provision or ordinance passed thereunder shall
  supersede any general law of the state defining or punishing crimes or misdemeanors.

       Subdivision 3. As authorized by law, certificates of indebtedness may be issued
  during each biennium, commencing on July 1 in each odd-numbered year and ending on
  and including June 30 in the next odd-numbered year, in anticipation of the collection of   
   taxes levied for and other revenues appropriated to any fund of the state for expenditure
  during that biennium.         
             No such certificates shall be issued with respect to any fund when the amount
  thereof with interest thereon to maturity, added to the then outstanding certificates against
  the same fund and interest thereon to maturity, will exceed the then unexpended balance
  of all moneys which will be credited to that fund during the biennium under existing
  laws; except that the maturities of any such certificates may be extended by refunding to a
  date not later .than December 1 of the first full calendar year following the biennium in
  which such certificates were issued.
           If moneys on hand in any fund are not sufficient to pay all non-refunding certificates
  of indebtedness issued on such fund during any biennium and all certificates refunding
  the same, plus interest thereon, which are outstanding on December 1 immediately
  following the close of such biennium, the state auditor shall levy upon all taxable
  property in the state a tax collectible in the  then ensuing year sufficient to pay the same
  on or before December 1 of such ensuing year, with interest to the date or dates of
  payment.
  
             Subdivision 4. Public debt other than certificates of indebtedness authorized in
  subdivision 3 shall be evidenced by the issuance of the bonds of this state. All bonds
  issued under the provisions of this section shall mature within not more than 20 years
  from their respective dates of issue, and each law authorizing the issuance of such bonds
  shall distinctly specify the purpose or purposes thereof and the maximum amount of the
  proceeds authorized to be expended for each purpose. The state treasurer shall maintain a
  separate and special state bond fund on his official books and records, and when the full
  faith and credit of the state has been pledged for the payment of such bonds the state     
  auditor shall levy each year on all taxable property within the state a tax sufficient, with
  the balance then on hand in said fund, to pay all principal and interest on state bonds
  issued under the provisions of this section, due and to become due within the then
  ensuing year and to and including July 1 in the second ensuing year. The legislature may
  by law appropriate funds from any source to the state bond fund, and the amount of
  moneys actually received and on hand pursuant to such appropriations prior to the levy of
  such tax in any year, shall be used to reduce the amount of tax otherwise required to be
