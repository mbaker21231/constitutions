Article V. Section 4

     (a) The supreme court of the state shall consist of not less than three nor more than five
justices as may be determined by the legislature.  The justices of the court shall elect one of their
number to serve as chief justice for such term and with such authority as shall be prescribed by
law.  A majority of the justices shall constitute a quorum, and a concurrence of a majority of such
quorum shall be sufficient to decide any matter.  If a justice of the supreme court for any reason
shall not participate in hearing any matter, the chief justice may designate one of the district
judges to act for such non-participating justice.  

(b) A vacancy in the office of justice of the supreme court or judge of any district court or of such
other courts that may be made subject to this provision by law, shall be filled by a qualified
person appointed by the governor from a list of three nominees that shall be submitted by the
judicial nominating commission. The commission shall submit such a list not later than 60 days
after the death, retirement, tender of resignation, removal, failure of an incumbent to file a
declaration of candidacy or certification of a negative majority vote on the question of retention
in office under section [subsection] (g) hereof. If the governor shall fail to make any such
appointment within 30 days from the day the list is submitted to him, such appointment shall be
made by the chief justice from the list within 15 days. 
(c) There shall be a judicial nominating commission for the supreme court, district courts and any
other courts to which these provisions may be extended by law. The commission shall consist of
seven members, one of whom shall be the chief justice, or a justice of the supreme court
designated by the chief justice to act for him, who shall be chairman thereof. In addition to the
chief justice, or his designee, three resident members of the bar engaged in active practice shall
be elected by the Wyoming State Bar and three electors of the state not admitted to practice law
shall be appointed by the governor to serve on said commission for such staggered terms as shall
be prescribed by law. No more than two members of said commission who are residents of the
same judicial district may qualify to serve any term or part of a term on the commission. In the
case of courts having less than statewide authority, each judicial district not otherwise
represented by a member on the commission, and each county, should the provisions hereof be
extended by law to courts of lesser jurisdiction than district courts, shall be represented by two
nonvoting advisors to the commission when an appointment to a court in such unrepresented
district, or county, is pending; both of such advisors shall be residents of the district, or county,
and one shall be a member of the bar appointed by the governing body of the Wyoming State Bar
and one shall be a nonattorney advisor appointed by the governor. 
(d) No member of the commission excepting the chairman shall hold any federal, state or county
public office or any political party office, and after serving a full term he shall not be eligible for
reelection or reappointment to succeed himself on the commission. No member of the judicial
nominating commission shall be eligible for appointment to any judicial office while he is a
member of the commission nor for a period of one year after the expiration of his term for which
he was elected or appointed. Vacancies in the office of commissioner shall be filled for the
unexpired terms in the same manner as the original appointments. Additional qualifications of
members of the commission may be prescribed by law. 
(e) The chairman of the commission shall cast votes only in the event of ties. The commission
shall operate under rules adopted by the supreme court. Members of the commission shall be
entitled to no compensation other than expenses incurred for travel and subsistence while
attending meetings of the commission. 
(f) The terms of supreme court justices shall be eight years and the terms of district court judges
shall be six years. 
(g) Each justice or judge selected under these provisions shall serve for one year after his
appointment and until the first Monday in January following the next general election after the
expiration of such year. He shall, at such general election, stand for retention in office on a ballot
which shall submit to the appropriate electorate the question whether such justice or judge shall
be retained in office for another term or part of a term, and upon filing a declaration of candidacy
in the form and at the times prescribed by law, he shall, at the general election next held before
the expiration of each term, stand for retention on such ballots. The electorate of the whole state
shall vote on the question of retention or rejection of justices of the supreme court, and any other
statewide court; the electorate of the several judicial districts shall vote on the question of
retention or rejection of judges of their respective districts, and the electorate of such other
subdivisions of the state as shall be prescribed by law shall vote on the question of retention or
rejection of any other judges to which these provisions may be extended. 
(h) A justice or judge selected hereunder, or one that is in office upon the effective date of this
amendment, who shall desire to retain his judicial office a succeeding term, following the
expiration of his existing term of office, shall file with the appropriate office not more than 6
months nor less than 3 months before the general election to be held before the expiration of his
existing term of office a declaration of intent to stand for election for a succeeding term.,
provided, however, that no name shall be placed upon the ballot without prior approval, after
hearing, of the judicial nominating commission.  When such a declaration of approval is allowed
and filed, the appropriate electorate shall vote upon a nonpartisan judicial ballot on the question
of retention in or rejection from office of such justice or judge, and if a majority of those voting
on the question vote affirmatively, the justice or judge shall be elected to serve the succeeding
term prescribed by law. If a justice or judge fails to file such a declaration within the time
specified, or if a majority of those voting on the question vote negatively to any judicial
candidacy, a vacancy will thereby be created in that office at the end of its existing term.

retirement and compensation of justices and judges of the supreme court and district courts, and
may do so for any other courts, on account of length of service, age and disability, and for their
reassignment to active duty where and when needed. The office of every such justice and judge
shall become vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy (70) years, as the legislature
may prescribe; but, in the case of an incumbent whose term of office includes the effective date
of this amendment, this provision shall not prevent him from serving the remainder of said term

States he pleads guilty or no contest or is found guilty of a crime punishable as a felony or one
involving moral turpitude under Wyoming or federal law.  If his conviction is reversed,
suspension terminates, and he shall be paid his salary for the period of suspension.  If he is
suspended and his conviction becomes final the supreme court shall remove him from office.  
(e) On recommendation of the judicial supervisory commission the supreme court may (1) retire
a justice or judge for disability that seriously interferes with the performance of his duties and is,

conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.
(f) A justice or judge retired by the supreme court shall be considered to have retired voluntarily
without loss of retirement benefits.  A justice or judge removed by the supreme court is ineligible

courts, define the jurisdiction of courts, or prescribe their rules, enact local or special legislation,
or enact that prohibited by the constitution for enactment by the legislature.  The referendum
shall not be applied to dedications of revenue, to appropriations, to local or special legislation, or

Article III. Section 52 (c). 

(a) The people may propose and enact laws by the initiative, and approve or reject acts of the
legislature by the referendum.

(b) An initiative or referendum is proposed by an application containing the bill to be initiated or
the act to be referred.  The application shall be signed by not less than one hundred (100)
qualified voters as sponsors, and shall be filed with the secretary of state.  If he finds it in proper
form he shall so certify.  Denial of certification shall be subject to judicial review.  

(c) After certification of the application, a petition containing a summary of the subject matter
shall be prepared by the secretary of state for circulation by the sponsors. The petition may be
filed with the secretary of state if it meets both of the following requirements:
          (i) It is signed by qualified voters, equal in number to fifteen percent (15%) of those who
     voted in the preceding general election; and
          (ii) It is signed by qualified voters equal in number to fifteen percent (15%) of those
     resident in at least two-thirds (2/3) of the counties of the state, as determined by those
     who voted in the preceding general election in that county.

(d) An initiative petition may be filed at any time except that one may not be filed for a measure
substantially the same as that defeated by an initiative election within the preceding (5) years. 
The secretary of state shall prepare a ballot title and proposition summarizing the proposed law,
and shall place them on the ballot for the first statewide election held more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after adjournment of the legislative session following the filing.  If, before the
election, substantially the same measure has been enacted, the petition is void.  

(e) A referendum petition may be filed only within ninety (90) days after adjournment of the
legislative session at which the act was passed, except that a referendum petition respecting any
act previously passed by the legislature may be filed within six months after the power of
referendum is adopted, The secretary of state shall prepare a ballot title and proposition
summarizing the act and shall place them on the ballot for the first statewide election held more

  (f) If votes in an amount in excess of fifty percent (50%) of those voting in the general election
are cast in favor of adoption of an initiated measure, the measure is enacted.  If votes in an
amount in excess of fifty percent (50%) of those voted in the general election are cast in favor of
rejection of an act referred, it is rejected.  The secretary of state shall certify the election returns. 
An initiated law becomes effective ninety (90) days after certification, is not subject to veto, and
may be repealed by the legislature within two (2) years of its effective date.  It may be amended
at any time.  An act rejected by referendum is void thirty (30) days after certification.  Additional
procedures for the initiative and referendum may be prescribed by law.  

(g) The initiative shall not be used to dedicate revenues, make or repeal appropriations, create
courts, define the jurisdiction of courts, or prescribe their rules, enact local or special legislation,
or enact that prohibited by the constitution for enactment by the legislature.  The referendum
shall not be applied to dedications of revenue, to appropriations, to local or special legislation, or
to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.

die as the result of such injuries, except in case of injuries due solely to the culpable negligence
of the injured employee. The fund or funds shall be accumulated, paid into the state treasury and

only for compensation authorized by this section, for administration and management of the
Worker's Compensation Act, debt service related to the fund and for workplace safety programs
