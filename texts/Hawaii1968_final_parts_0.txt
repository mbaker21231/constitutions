  REAPPORTIONMENT YEARS.  The year 1973 and every eighth year thereafter shall be
  reapportionment years.
  
  REAPPORTIONMENT COMMISSION.  A legislative reapportionment commission shall
  be constituted on or before March 1 of each reapportionment year and whenever
  reapportionment is required by court order. The commission shall consist of nine
  members. The president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives shall
  each select two members. Members of each house belonging to the party or parties
  different from that of the president or the speaker shall designate one of their number for
  each house and the two so designated shall each select two members of the commission.
  The eight members so selected shall, promptly after selection, be certified by the selecting
  authorities to the chief election officer and shall within thirty days thereafter select, by a
  vote of six members, and promptly certify to the chief election officer the ninth member
  who shall serve as chairman of the commission.
       Each of the four officials designated above as selecting authorities for the eight
  members of the commission shall, at the time of the commission selections, also select one
  person from each basic island unit to an apportionment advisory council for that island
  unit. The councils shall remain in existence during the life of the commission and each shall
  serve in an advisory capacity to the commission for matters affecting its island unit.
       A vacancy in the commission or a council shall be filled by the initial selecting authority
  within fifteen days after the vacancy occurs. Commission and council positions and
  vacancies not filled within the times specified shall be filled promptly thereafter by the
  supreme court.
       The commission shall act by majority vote of its membership and shall establish its own
  procedures except as may be provided by law.
       Not more than one hundred twenty days from the date on which its members are
  certified the commission shall file with the chief election officer a reapportionment plan,
  which shall become law after publication as provided by law. Members of the commission
  shall hold office until the  reapportionment plan becomes effective or until such time as
  may be provided by law.
       No member of the reapportionment commission or an apportionment advisory council
  shall be eligible to become a candidate for election to either house of the legislature in
  either of the first two elections under any such reapportionment plan.
       Commission and apportionment advisory council members shall be compensated and
  reimbursed for their necessary expenses as provided by law.
       The chief election officer shall be secretary of the commission without vote and, under
  the direction of the commission, shall furnish all necessary technical services. The
  legislature shall appropriate funds to enable the commission to carry out its duties.
           
  CHIEF ELECTION OFFICER.  The legislature shall provide for a chief election officer of
  the State, whose responsibilities shall be as prescribed by law and shall include the
  supervision of state elections, the maximization of registration of eligible voters
  throughout the State and the maintenance of data concerning registered voters, elections,
  apportionment and districting.
           
  APPORTIONMENT AMONG BASIC ISLAND UNITS.  The commission shall allocate
  the total number of members of each house being reapportioned among the four basic
  island units, namely (1) the island of Hawaii, (2) the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and
  Kahoolawe, (3) the island of Oahu and all other islands not specifically enumerated, and
  (4) the islands of Kauai and Niihau, on the basis of the number of voters registered in the
  last preceding general election in each of the basic island units and computed by the
  method known as the method of equal proportions, except that no basic island unit shall
  receive less than one member in each house.
           
  MINIMUM REPRESENTATION FOR BASIC ISLAND UNITS.  The representation of
  any basic island unit initially allocated less than a minimum of two senators and three
  representatives shall be augmented by allocating thereto the number of senators or
  representatives necessary to attain such minimums which number, notwithstanding the
  provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of this article shall be added to the membership of the   
  appropriate body until the next reapportionment.  The senators or representatives of any
  basic island unit so augmented shall exercise a fractional vote wherein the numerator is the
  number initially allocated and the denominator is the minimum above specified.
           
  APPORTIONMENT WITHIN BASIC ISLAND UNITS.  Upon the determination of the
  total number of members of each house to which each basic island unit is entitled, the
  commission shall apportion the members among the districts therein and shall redraw
  district lines where necessary in such manner that for each house the average number of
  registered voters per member in each district is as nearly equal to the average for the basic
  island unit as practicable.
       In effecting such redistricting, the commission shall be guided by the following criteria:
       1. No district shall extend beyond the boundaries of any basic island unit.
       2. No district shall be so drawn as to unduly favor a person or political faction.
       3.   Except in the case of districts encompassing more than one island, districts shall be
       contiguous.
       4.   Insofar as practicable, districts shall be compact.
       5.   Where possible, district lines shall follow permanent and easily recognized features, 
          such as streets, streams and clear geographical features, and when practicable
       shall coincide with census tract boundaries.
       6.   Where practicable, representative districts shall be wholly included within senatorial
       districts.
       7.   Not more than four members shall be elected from any district.
       8.   Where practicable, submergence of an area in a larger district wherein substantially  
         different socio-economic interests predominate shall be avoided.
  
  MANDAMUS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.  Original jurisdiction is vested in the supreme
  Court of the State to be exercised on the petition of any registered voter whereby it may
  compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the appropriate person or  persons to perform their
  duty or to correct any error made in a reapportionment plan, or it may take such other
  action to effectuate the purposes of this section as it may deem appropriate. Any such
  petition must be filed within forty-five days of the date specified for any duty or within
  forty-five days after the filing  of a reapportionment plan.

  "general obligation bonds" means all bonds for the payment of the principal and interest of
  which the full faith and credit of the State or a political subdivision are pledged; and the
  term "revenue bonds" means all bonds payable solely from and secured solely by the
  revenues, or user taxes, or any combination of both, of a public undertaking, improvement
  or system.
       All bonds issued by or on behalf of the State or a political subdivision must be
  authorized by the legislature, and bonds of a political subdivision must also be authorized
  by its governing body.
       Bonds may be issued by the State when authorized by a two-thirds vote of the
  members to which each house of the legislature is entitled, provided that such bonds at the
  time of authorization would not cause the total of state indebtedness to exceed a sum
  equal to three and one-half times the average of the general fund revenues of the State in
  the three fiscal years immediately preceding the session of the legislature authorizing such
  issuance. For the purpose of this paragraph, general fund revenues of the State shall not
  include monies received as grants from the federal government and receipts in
  reimbursement of any indebtedness that is excluded in computing the total indebtedness of
  the State.
       By majority vote of the members to which each house of the legislature is entitled and
  without regard to any debt limit, there may be issued by or on behalf of the State: bonds to
  meet appropriations for any fiscal period in anticipation of the collection of revenues for
  such period or to meet casual deficits or failures of revenue, if required to be paid within
  one year; bonds to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, to defend the State in war or
  to meet emergencies caused by disaster or act of God; and revenue bonds.
       A sum equal to fifteen percent of the total of the assessed values for tax rate purposes
  of real property in any political subdivision, as determined by the last tax assessment rolls
  pursuant to law, is established as the limit of the funded debt of such political subdivision
  that is outstanding and unpaid at any time.
       Bonds to meet appropriations for any fiscal period in anticipation of the collection of
  revenues for such period or to meet casual deficits or failures of revenue, if required to be
  paid within one year, may be issued by any political subdivision under authorization of law
  and of its governing body without regard to any debt limit.
       All general obligation bonds for a term exceeding one year shall be in serial form
  maturing in substantially equal installments of principal, or maturing in substantially equal
  installment of both principal and interest, the first installment of principal to mature not
  later than five years from the date of the issue of such series, and the last installment not
  later than thirty-five years from the date of such issue. The interest and principal payments
  of general obligation bonds shall be a first charge on the general fund of the State or
  political subdivision, as the case may be.
       In determining the total indebtedness of the State or funded debt of any political
  subdivision, the following shall be excluded:
           
     (a)    Bonds that have matured, or that mature in the then current fiscal year, or that have
     been irrevocably called for redemption and the redemption date has occurred or will
     occur in the then fiscal year, and for the full payment of which monies have been
     irrevocably set aside.
     (b)    Revenue bonds, authorized or issued, if the issuer thereof is obligated by law to
     impose rates and charges for the use and services of the public undertaking,
     improvement or system, or to impose a user tax, or to impose a combination of rates
     and charges and user tax, as the case may be, sufficient to pay the cost of operation,
     maintenance and repair of the public undertaking, improvement or system and the
     required payments of the principal of and interest on all revenue bonds issued for the
     public undertaking, improvement or system, and if the issuer is obligated to deposit
     such revenues or tax or a combination of both into a special fund and to apply the
     same to such payments in the amount necessary therefor. For the purposes of this
     section a user tax shall mean a tax on goods or services or on the consumption
     thereof, the receipts of which are substantially derived from the consumption, use or
     sale of goods and services in the utilization of the functions or services furnished by
     the public undertaking, improvement or system.
     (c)    Bonds authorized or issued under special improvement statutes when the only
     security for such bonds is the properties benefited or improved or theassessments
     thereon.
     (d)    General obligation bonds authorized or issued for assessable improvements, but only
     to the extent that reimbursements to the general fund for the principal and interest on
     such bonds are in fact made from assessment collections available therefor.
     (e)    General obligation bonds issued for a public undertaking, improvement or system
     from which revenues, user taxes, or a combination of both may be derived for the
     payment of all or part of the principal and interest as reimbursement to the general      
      fund, but only to the extent that reimbursements to the general fund are in fact made
     from the net revenue, net user tax receipts, or combination of both, as determined for
     the immediately preceding fiscal year. For the purposes of this section, net revenue or
     net user tax receipts shall be the revenue or receipts remaining after the costs of
     operation, maintenance and repair of such public undertaking, improvement or
     system and the required payments of the principal of and interest on all revenue
     bonds    issued therefor have been made.
     (f)    General obligation bonds of the State, authorized but unissued, for an existing public
     undertaking, improvement or system that produces revenues, or user tax receipts, or
     a combination of both, but only if in the fiscal year immediately preceding the
     authorization, the public undertaking, improvement or system produced a net
     revenue, net user taxes or a combination of both, that was sufficient to pay into the
     general fund the full amount of the principal and interest then due for all general
     obligation bonds then outstanding for such public undertaking, improvement or
     system.  
     (g)    General obligation bonds of the State, authorized but unissued, for an existing public
     undertaking, improvement or system that has not been self-sustaining as determined
     for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and that produces revenues, or user tax
     receipts, or a combination of both, but only if the rates or charges for the use and       
     services of the undertaking have been, or the rate of such user tax has been, increased
     by law or by the issuing body as authorized by law, in an amount that is determined
     will produce sufficient net revenue or net user taxes, or any combination thereof, for
     reimbursement to the general fund for the payment of principal and interest on all
     general obligation bonds then outstanding and authorized for such public
     undertaking, improvement or system.
     (h)    General obligation bonds issued by the State for any political subdivision, whether
     issued before or after the effective date of this section, but only for as long as
     reimbursement by the political subdivision to the State for the payment of principal
     and interest on such bonds is required by law; provided that in the case of bonds
     authorized or issued after the effective date of this amendment, the consent of the
     governing body of the political subdivision has first been obtained; and provided
     further that during the period that such bonds are excluded from total indebtedness of
     the State, the principal amount then outstanding shall be included within the funded
     debt of such political subdivision.
   Determinations of the exclusions from the total indebtedness of the State or funded
   debt of any political subdivision provided for in this section shall be made annually and
   certified by law or as prescribed by law. For the purposes of this section, amounts
   received from on-street parking may be considered and treated as revenues of a parking
   undertaking.
  Nothing in this section shall prevent the refunding of any bond at any time.
