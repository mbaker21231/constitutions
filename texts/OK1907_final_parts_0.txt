manner in which appeals may be taken to the Supreme Court from the District Courts, except
that such an appeal shall be of right, and the Supreme Court may provide by rule for proceedings
in the matter of appeals in any particular in which the existing rules of law are inapplicable. If
such appeal be taken by the corporation whose rates, charges, or classifications of traffic,

but, in the other cases mentioned, the corporation so affected shall be made the appellee. The
Legislature may also, by general laws, provide for appeals from any other action of the
Commission, by the State, or by

21. Upon the granting of an appeal, a writ of supersedeas may be awarded by the Supreme Court,
suspending the operation of the action appealed from until the final disposition of the appeal; but
prior to the final reversal thereof by the Supreme Court, no action of the Commission prescribing
or affecting the rates, charges, or classifications of traffic of any transportation or transmission
company shall be delayed, or suspended, in its operation, by reason of any appeal by such
corporation, or by reason of any proceeding resulting from such appeal, until a suspending bond
shall first have been executed and filed with, and approved by the Commission (or approved, on
review, by the Supreme Court), payable to the State, and sufficient in amount and security to        
insure the prompt refunding, by the appealing corporation to the parties entitled thereto, of all
charges which such company may collect or receive, pending the appeal, in excess of those fixed,
or authorized, by the final decision of the court on appeal. The Commission, upon the execution
of such bond, shall forthwith require the appealing company, under penalty of the immediate
enforcement (pending the appeal and notwithstanding the supersedeas), of the order or
requirement appealed from, to keep such accounts, and to make to the Commission, from time
to time, such reports, verified by oath, as may, in the judgment of the Commission, suffice to
show the amounts being charged or received by the company, pending the appeal, in excess of
the charge allowed by the action of the Commission appealed from, together with the names and
addresses of the persons to whom such overcharges will be refundable in case the charges made
by the company, pending the appeal, be not sustained on such appeal; and the Commission shall
also, from time to time, require such company, under like penalty, to give additional security on,
or to increase the said suspending bond, whenever, in the opinion of the Commission, the same
may be necessary to insure the prompt refunding of the overcharges aforesaid. Upon the final
decision of such appeal, all amounts which the appealing company may have collected, pending
the appeal, in excess of that authorized by such final decision, shall be promptly refunded by the
company to the parties entitled thereto, in such manner and through such methods of distribution
as may be prescribed by the Commission, or by law. All such appeals, affecting rates, charges, or
classifications of traffic, shall have precedence upon the docket of the Supreme Court, and shall
be heard and disposed of promptly by the court, irrespective of its place of session, next after the
habeas corpus, and State cases already on tie docket of the court.

22. In no case of appeal from the Commission, shall any new or additional evidence be

Commission, shall certify to the Supreme Court all the facts upon which the action appealed

such of the evidence introduced before, or considered by, the Commission as may be selected,

introduced or considered as the Commission may deem proper to certify. The Commission shall,
whenever an appeal is taken therefrom, file with the record of the ease and as a part thereof, a
written statement of the reasons upon which the action appealed from was based, and such
statement shall be read and considered by the Supreme Court, upon disposing of the appeal. The
Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction, on such appeal, to consider and determine the
reasonableness and justness
of the action of the Commission appealed from, as well as any other matter arising under such
appeal. Provided, however, that the action of the Commission appealed from shall be regarded as
prima facie just, reasonable, and correct; but the court may, when it deems necessary, in the
interest of justice, remand to the Commission any case pending on appeal, and require the same
to be further investigated by the Commission, and reported upon to the court (together with a
certificate of such additional evidence as may be tendered before the Commission by any party in
interest), before the appeal is finally decided.

been entered by the Commission at the time the original order appealed from was entered. The
right of the Commission to prescribe and enforce rates, charges, classifications, rules and
regulations affecting any or all actions of the Commission theretofore entered by it and appealed

such appeal; but no order of the Commission prescribing or altering such rates, charges,
