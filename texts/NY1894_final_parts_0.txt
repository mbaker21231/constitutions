and of the Judges transferred thereto by the fifth section of this article, all of whom shall continue
to be Justices of the Supreme Court during their respective terms, and of twelve additional
Justices who shall reside in and be chosen by the electors of the several existing judicial districts,
three in the       first district, three in the second, and one in each of the other districts; and of
their successors. The successors of said Justices shall be chosen by the electors of their respective

2. The Legislature shall divide the State into four judicial departments.  The first department
shall consist of the county of New York; the others shall be bounded by county lines, and be
compact     and equal in population as nearly as may be. Once every ten years the Legislature
may
alter the judicial departments, but without increasing the number thereof. There shall be an
appellate division of the Supreme Court, consisting of seven justices in the first department, and
of five justices in each of the other departments. In each department four shall constitute a
quorum, and the concurrence of three shall be necessary to a decision. No more than five justices
shall sit in any case.
    From all the justices elected to the Supreme Court the Governor shall designate those who
shall constitute the Appellate Division in each department; and he shall designate the presiding
justice thereof, who shall act as such during his term of office, and shall be a resident of the
department. The other justices shall be designated for terms of five years, or the unexpired
portions of their respective terms of office, if less than five years. From time to time as the terms
of such      designations expire, or vacancies occur, he shall 'make new designations. He may also
make temporary designations in case of the absence or inability to act, of any justice in the
Appellate Division. A majority of the justices designated to sit in the Appellate Division in each
department shall be residents of the department. Whenever the Appellate Division in any
department shall be unable to dispose of its business within a reasonable time, a majority of the
presiding justices of the several departments at a meeting called by the presiding justice of the
department in arrears may transfer fly pending appeals from such department to any other
department for hearing and determination. No justice of the Appellate Division shall exercise any
of the powers of a justice of the Supreme Court, other than those of a justice out of court, and
those pertaining to the Appellate Division or to the hearing and decision of motions submitted by
consent of counsel.         From and after the last day of December, one thousand eight hundred
and ninety-five, the Appellate Division shall have the jurisdiction now exercised by the Supreme
Court at its General Terms, and by the General terms of the Court of Common Pleas for the City

laws shall not be passed except in conformity with the provisions of this section. After any bill

may provide for the concurrence of the legislative body in cities of the first class. The Legislature

every city to which it relates, before action thereon. Such a bill, if it relates to more than one city,
