of the constitution of this State shall be, and they are hereby declared to be, valid parts of the said
constitution; and the said third, seventh, and ninth sections, or such parts thereof as are repugnant
to such amendments, are hereby repealed and made void.]
The house of representatives shall consist of one hundred and twenty-four members, to be
apportioned among the several election districts of the State, according to the number of white
inhabitants contained, and the amount of all taxes raised by the legislature, whether direct or
indirect, or of whatever species, paid in each, deducting therefrom all taxes paid on account of
property held in any other district, and adding thereto all taxes elsewhere paid on account of
property held in such district. An enumeration of the white inhabitants, or this purpose, shall be
made in the year one thousand eight hundred and nine, and in the course of every tenth year
thereafter, in such manner as shall be by law directed; and representatives shall be assigned to the
different, districts in the abovementioned proportion, by act of legislature, at the session imme-

diately succeeding the above enumeration.
If the enumeration herein directed should not be made in the course of the year appointed for the
purpose by these amendments, it shall be the duty of the governor to have it effected as soon
thereafter as shall be practicable.
In assigning representatives to the several districts of the State, the legislature shall allow one
representative for every sixty-second part of the whole number of white inhabitants in the State;
and one representative also for every sixty-second part of the whole taxes raised by the
legislature of the State. The legislature shall further allow one representative for such fractions of
the sixty-second part of the white inhabitants of the State, and of the sixty-second part of the
taxes raised by the legislature of the State, as, when added together, form a unit.
In every apportionment of representation under these amendments, which shall take place after
the first apportionment, the amount of taxes shall be estimated from the average of the ten
preceding years; but the first apportionment shall be founded upon the tax of the preceding year,
excluding from the amount thereof the whole produce of the tax on sales at public auction.
If, in the apportionment of representatives under these amendments, any election district shall
appear not to be entitled, from its population and its taxes, to a representative, such election
district shall, nevertheless, send one representative; and, if there should be still a deficiency of
