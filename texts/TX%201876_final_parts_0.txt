people, subject to the following provisions:
First. In the territory of the State exterior to all counties now existing, no new counties shall be
created with a less area than nine hundred square miles, in a square form, unless prevented by
preexisting boundary-lines. Should the State-lines render this impracticable in border counties,
the area may be less. The territory referred to may, at any, time, in whole or in part, be divided

the most convenient organized county or counties.
Second. Within the territory of any county or counties now existing, no new county shall be
created with a less area than seven hundred square miles, nor shall any such county now existing
be reduced to a less area than seven hundred square miles. No new counties shall be created so as
to approach nearer than twelve miles of the county-seat of any county from which it may in
whole or in part, be taken. Counties of a less area than nine hundred, but of seven hundred or
more square miles, within counties now existing, may be created by a two-thirds vote of each
house of the legislature, taken by yeas and nays, and entered on the journals. Any county now
existing may be reduced to an area of not less than seven hundred square miles by a like

county, the part stricken off shall be holden for and obliged to pay its proportion of all the
liabilities then existing of the county from which it was taken, in such manner as may be
prescribed by law.
Third. No part of any existing county shall be detached from it and attached to another existing
county until the proposition for in such manner as may be such change shall have been
submitted, provided by law, to a vote of the electors of both counties, and shall have received a
