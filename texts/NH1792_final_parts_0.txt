     Part First

The Bill of Rights
*** SSTART 001.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***


     Article I.  All men are born equally free and independent; therefore, all government of right

     Art. III. When men enter into a state of society, they surrender up some of their natural
rights to that society, in order to insure the protection of others; and, without such an equivalent,
the surrender is void.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 004.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. IV. Among the natural rights, some are in their very nature unalienable, because no
equivalent can be given or received for them. Of this kind are the RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 005.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. V. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship GOD according to the
dictates of his own conscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in
his person, liberty or estate for worshipping GOD, in the manner and season most agreeable to the
dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profession, sentiments or persuasion; provided
he doth not disturb the public peace, or disturb others, in their religious worship.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 006.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. VI. As morality and piety, rightly grounded on evangelical principles, will give the
best and greatest security to government, and will lay in the hearts of men the strongest
obligations to due subjection; and as the knowledge of these, is most likely to be propagated
through a society by the institution of the public worship of the DEITY, and of public instruction
in morality and religion; therefore, to promote those important purposes, the people of this state
have a right to impower, and do hereby fully impower the legislature to authorize from time to
time, the several towns, parishes, bodies-corporate, or religious societies within this state, to
make adequate provision at their own expence, for the support and maintenance of public
protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality:
     Provided notwithstanding, That the several towns, parishes, bodies-corporate, or religious
societies, shall at all times have the exclusive right of electing their own public teachers, and of
contracting with them for their support and maintenance. And no portion of any one particular
religious sect or denomination, shall ever be compelled to pay towards the support of the teacher
or teachers of another persuasion, sect or denomination.
     And every denomination of christians demeaning themselves quietly, and as good subjects
of the state, shall be equally under the protection of the law: and no subordination of any one sect
or denomination to another, shall ever be established by law.
     And nothing herein shall be understood to affect any former contracts made for the
support of the ministry; but all such contracts shall remain, and be in the same state as if this
constitution had not been made.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 007.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. VII. The people of this state, have the sole and exclusive right of governing
themselves as a free, sovereign, and independent state, and do, and forever hereafter shall,
exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction and right pertaining thereto, which is not, or may not
hereafter be by them expressly delegated to the United States of America in Congress assembled.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 008.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. VIII. All power residing originally in, and being derived from the people, all the

    Art. IX. No office or place whatsoever in government, shall be hereditary-the abilities and
integrity requisite in all, not being transmissible to posterity or relations.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 010.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. X. Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of
the whole community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family or
class of men; therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty
manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right
ought, to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of non-resistance against
arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of
mankind.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 011.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. XI. All elections ought to be free, and every inhabitant of the state having the proper

*** SSTART 012.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. XII. Every member of the community has a right to be protected by it in the
enjoyment of his life, liberty and property; he is therefore bound to contribute his share in the
expence of such protection, and to yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent.
But no part of a man's property shall be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his
own consent, or that of the representative body of the people. Nor are the inhabitants of this state
controllable by any other laws than those to which they or their representative body have given
their consent.

*** SSTART 014.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. XIV. Every subject of this state is entitled to a certain remedy, by having recourse to
the laws, for all injuries lie may receive in his person, property or character, to obtain right and
justice freely, without being obliged to purchase it; completely, and without any denial; promptly,
and without delay, conformably to the laws.

     Art. XV. No subject shall be held to answer for any crime, or offence, until the same is
fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse or furnish
evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be
favorable to himself; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his
defence by himself, and counsel. And no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled or
deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled or
deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 016.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. XVI. No subject shall be liable to be tried, after an acquittal, for the same crime or
offence. --Nor shall the legislature make any law that shall subject any person to a capital
punishment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, and the militia in actual service,
without trial by jury.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 017.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     Art. XVII. In criminal prosecutions, the trial of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is
so essential to the security of the life, liberty and estate of the citizen, that no crime or offence
ought to be tried in any other county than that in which it is committed; except in cases of general
insurrection in any particular county, when it shall appear to the Judges of the Superior Court,
that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the offence may be committed, and upon
their report, the legislature shall think proper to direct the trial in the nearest county in which an
impartial trial can be obtained.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 018.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XVIII. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offence. No wise
legislature will affix the same punishment to the crimes of theft, forgery and the like, which they
do to those of murder and treason.   Where the same undistinguishing severity is exerted against
all offences, the people are led to forget the real distinction in the crimes themselves, and to
commit the most flagrant with as little compunction as they do the lightest offences.  For the same
reason a multitude of sanguinary laws is both impolitic and unjust; the true design of all
punishments being to reform, not to exterminate, mankind.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 019.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XIX. Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of
his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions; Therefore, All warrants to search
suspected places, or arrest a person for examination or trial, in prosecutions for criminal matters,
are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously cupposred by oath
or affirmation; and if the order in a warrant to a civil officer to make search in suspected places,
or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize thier property, be not accompanied with a
special designation of the persons or object of search, arrest, or seizure; and no warrant ought to
be issued but in cases and with the formalities prescribed by law.

*** SSTART 020.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***

     XX.  In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons,
except in cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practiced, the parties have a
right to a trial by jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless in causes arising
on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners wages, the legislature shall think it necessary
hereafter to alter it.
[The original constitution had "causes" instead of "cases" This appears to have been altered in the
1792 parchment copy without authorization]

*** SSTART 021.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
   XXI. In order to reap the fullest advantage of the inestimable privilege of the trial by Jury, great
care ought to be taken that none but qualified persons be appointed to serve; and such ought to be
fully compensated for their travel, time and attendance.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 022.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXII. The Liberty of the Press is essential to the security of freedom in a state; it ought,
therefore, to be inviolably preserved.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 023.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXIII. Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws, therefore,
should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offences.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 024.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
      XXIV. A well regulated militia is the proper, natural, and sure defence of a state.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 025.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
      XXV. Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without
the consent of the legislature.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 026.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXVI. In all cases, and at all times, the military ought to be under strict subordination to, and
governed by the civil power.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 027.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
      XXVII. No soldier in time of peace, shall be quartered in any house without the consent of
the owner; and in time of war, quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a
manner ordained by the legislature.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 028.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
        XXVIII. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost or duty shall be established, fixed, laid, or
levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people or their representatives in
the legislature, or authority derived from that body.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 029.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
        XXIX. The power of suspending the laws, or the execution of them, ought never to be
exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived therefrom, to be exercised in such
particular cases only as the legislature shall expressly provide for.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 030.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
        XXX. The freedom of deliberation, speech, and debate, in either house of the legislature,
is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any action, complaint,
or prosecution, in any other court or place whatsoever.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 031.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
        XXXI. The legislature shall assemble for the redress of public grievances, and for
making such laws as the public good may require.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 032.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
         XXXII. The people have a right in an orderly and peaceable manner, to assemble and
consult upon the common good, give instructions to their representatives; and to request of the
legislative body, by way of petition or remonstrance, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the
grievances they suffer.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 033.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
        XXXIII. No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose
excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 034.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXXIV. No person can in any case be subjected to law martial, or to any pains, or penalties,
by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual
service, but by authority of the legislature.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 035.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXXV. It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty,
property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws  and administration of
justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will
admit. It is, therefore not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, that
the judges of the supreme  judicial court should hold their offices so long as they behave well;
subject, however, to such limitations on account of age as may be provided by the constitution of
the State; and that they should have honorable salaries, ascertained and established by standing
laws.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 036.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXXVI. Economy being a most essential virtue in all states, especially in a young one; no
pension shall be granted, but in consideration of actual services, and such pensions ought to be
granted with great caution, by the legislature, and never for more than one year at a time.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 037.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXXVII. In the government of this state, the three essential powers thereof, to wit, the
legislative, executive and judicial, ought to be kept as separate from and independent of each
other, as the nature of a free government will admit, or as is consistent with that chain of
connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of union and
amity.
*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 038.0 001.0 0 NH 1792 ***
     XXXVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, and a
constant adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, industry, frugality, and all the social
virtues, are indispensably necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty and good government; the
people ought, therefore, to have a particular regard to all principles in the choice of their officers
and representatives: and they have a right to require of their law-givers and magistrates, an exact
and constant observance of them in the formation and execution of the laws necessary for the
good administration of government.

reason of physical or mental incapacity and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the
contrary, the president of the senate, for the time being, shall act as governor as provided in
article 49, subject to the succession provisions therein set forth.  Whenever it reasonably appears
to the attorney general and a majority of the council that the governor is unable to discharge the
powers and duties of his office by reason of physical or mental incapacity, but the governor is
unwilling or unable to transmit his written declaration to such effect as above provided, the
attorney general shall file a petition for declaratory judgment in the supreme court requesting a
judicial determination of the ability of the governor to discharge the powers and duties of his
office.  After notice and hearing, the justices of the supreme court shall render such judgment as
they find warranted by a preponderance of the evidence; and, if the court holds that the governor
is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the president of the senate, for the time
being, shall act as governor as provided in article 49, subject to the succession provisions therein
set forth, until such time as the disability of the governor is removed or a newly elected governor
is inaugurated.  Such disability, once determined by the supreme court, may be removed upon
petition for declaratory judgment to the supreme court by the governor if the court finds, after
notice and hearing, by a preponderance of the evidence that the governor is able to discharge the
powers and duties of his office.  Whenever such disability of the governor, as determined by his
written declaration or by judgment of the supreme court, has continued for a period of 6 months,
the general court may, by concurrent resolution adopted by both houses, declare the office of
governor vacant.  Whenever the governor-elect fails to qualify by reason of physical or mental
incapacity or any cause other than death or resignation, for a period of 6 months following the
inauguration date established by this constitution, the general court may, by concurrent resolution
adopted by both houses, declare the office of governor vacant.  The provisions of article 49 shall
govern the filling of such vacancy, either by special election or continued service of an acting
governor.  If the general court is not in session when any such 6-month period expires, the acting
governor, upon written request of at least l/4 of the members of each house, shall convene the
general court in special session for the sole purpose of considering and acting on the question
whether to declare a vacancy in the office of governor under this article.
