DECLARATION OF RIGHTS

property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.

SEC. 2. All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the protection,
security, and benefit of the people; and they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever
the public good may require it. But the paramount allegiance of every citizen is due to the
Federal Government, in the exercise of all its constitutional powers, as the same have been, or
may be, defined by the Supreme Court of the United States, and no power exists in the people of
this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith, or perform
any act tending to impair, subvert, or resist the supreme authority of the Government of the
United States. The Constitution of the United States confers full power on the Federal
Government to maintain and perpetuate its existence, and whensoever any portion of the States,
or people thereof, attempt to secede from the Federal Union, or forcibly resist the execution of its
laws, the Federal Government may, by warrant of the Constitution, employ armed force in
compelling obedience to its authority.

force and effect as a verdict by the whole jury; provided, the Legislature, by a law passed by a
