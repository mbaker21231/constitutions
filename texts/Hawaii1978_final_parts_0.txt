  and interest of which the full faith and credit of the State or a political subdivision are
  pledged and, unless otherwise indicated, includes reimbursable general obligation bonds.
  3. The term "net revenues" or "net user tax receipts" means the revenues or receipts
  derived from a public undertaking, improvement or system remaining after the costs of
  operation, maintenance and repair of such public undertaking, improvement or system and

  from the operation or lease of a public undertaking, improvement or system, or derived
  from any payments or return on security under a loan program or a loan thereunder.
  6. The term "reimbursable general obligation bonds" means general obligation bonds
  issued for a public undertaking, improvement or system from which revenues, or user
  taxes, or a combination of both, may be derived for the payment of the principal and
  interest as reimbursement to the general fund and for which reimbursement is required by
  law, and, in the case of general obligation bonds issued by the State for a political  
  subdivision, general obligation bonds for which the payment of the principal and interest as
  reimbursement to the general fund is required by law to be made from the revenue of the
  political subdivision.
  7. The term "revenue bonds" means all bonds payable from the revenues, or user taxes, or
  any combination of both, of a public undertaking, improvement, system or loan program
  and any loan made thereunder and secured as may be provided by law.

  authorize the issuance of all general obligation bonds, bonds issued under special
  improvement statutes and revenue bonds issued by or on behalf of the State and shall
  prescribe by general law the manner and procedure for such issuance. The legislature by
  general law shall authorize political subdivisions to issue general obligation bonds, bonds 
  issued under special improvement statutes and revenue bonds and shall prescribe the
  manner and procedure for such issuance. All such bonds issued by or on behalf of a
  political subdivision shall be authorized by the governing body of such political
  subdivision.

  or for, or to loan the proceeds of such bonds to assist, manufacturing, processing or
  industrial enterprises, utilities serving the general public, health care facilities provided to
  the general public by not-for-profit corporations or low and moderate income government
  housing programs, each of which is hereinafter referred to in this paragraph as a special

  is entitled, may enact enabling legislation for the issuance of special purpose revenue
  bonds separately for each special purpose entity, and, by a two-thirds vote of the members

  payment thereof.  The governor shall provide the legislature in November of each year
  with a report on the cumulative amount of all special purpose revenue bonds authorized
  and issued, and such other information as may be necessary.

  SEC. 13.  DEBT LIMIT; EXCLUSIONS.  General obligation bonds may be issued by the
  State; provided that such bonds at the time of issuance would not cause the total amount
  of principal and interest payable in the current or any future fiscal year, whichever is
  higher, on such bonds and on all outstanding general obligation bonds to exceed: a sum
  equal to twenty percent of the average of the general fund revenues of the State in the
  three fiscal years immediately preceding such issuance until June 30, 1982; and thereafter,
  a sum equal to eighteen and one-half percent of the average of the general fund revenues
  of the State in the three fiscal years immediately preceding such issuance.  Effective July 1,
  1980, the legislature shall include a declaration of findings in every general law authorizing
  the issuance of general obligation bonds that the total amount of principal and interest,
  estimated for such bonds and for all bonds authorized and unissued and calculated for all
  bonds issued and outstanding, will not cause the debt limit to be exceeded at the time of
  issuance. Any bond issue by or on behalf of the State may exceed the debt limit if an
  emergency condition is declared to exist by the governor and concurred to by a two-thirds
  vote of the members to which each house of the legislature is entitled. For the purpose of
  this paragraph, general fund revenues of the State shall not include moneys received as
  grants from the federal government and receipts in reimbursement of any      reimbursable
  general obligation bonds which are excluded as permitted by this section.
       A sum equal to fifteen percent of the total of the assessed values for tax rate purposes
  of real property in each political subdivision, as determined by the last tax assessment rolls
  pursuant to law, is established as the limit of the funded debt of such political subdivision
  that is outstanding and unpaid at any time.
       All general obligation bonds for a term exceeding two years shall be in serial form
  maturing in substantially equal installments of principal, or maturing in substantially equal
  installments of both principal and interest.  The first installment of principal of general
  obligation bonds and of reimbursable general obligation bonds shall mature not later than
  five years from the date of issue of such series. The last installment on general obligation
  bonds shall mature not later than twenty-five years from the date of such issue and the last
  installment on general obligation bonds sold to the federal government, on reimbursable
  general obligation bonds and on bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under
  which the State or a political subdivision incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor shall
  mature not later than thirty-five years from the date of such issue. The interest and
  principal payments of general obligation bonds shall be a first charge on the general fund
  of the State or political subdivision, as the case may be.
       In determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds or the funded
  debt of any political subdivision under section 12, the following shall be excluded:
  1. Bonds that have matured, or that mature in the then current fiscal year, or that have
  been irrevocably called for redemption and the redemption date has occurred or will occur
  in the then fiscal year, or for the full payment of which moneys or securities have been
  irrevocably set aside.
  2. Revenue bonds, if the issuer thereof is obligated by law to impose rates, rentals and
  charges for the use and services of the public undertaking, improvement or system or the
  benefits of a loan program or a loan thereunder or to impose a user tax, or to impose a
  combination of rates, rentals and charges and user tax, as the case may be, sufficient to
  pay the cost of operation, maintenance and repair, if any, of the public undertaking,
  improvement or system or the cost of maintaining a loan program or a loan thereunder and
  the required payments of the principal of and interest on all revenue bonds issued for the
  public undertaking, improvement or system or loan program, and if the issuer is obligated
  to deposit such revenues or tax or a combination of both into a special fund and to apply
  the same to such payments in the amount necessary therefor.
  3. Special purpose revenue bonds, if the issuer thereof is required by law to contract with
  a person obligating such person to make rental or other payments to the issuer in an
  amount at least sufficient to make the required payment of the principal of and interest on
  such special purpose revenue bonds.
  4. Bonds issued under special improvement statutes when the only security for such bonds
  is the properties benefitted or improved or the assessments thereon.
  5. General obligation bonds issued for assessable improvements, but only to the extent that
  reimbursements to the general fund for the principal and interest on such bonds are in fact
  made from assessment collections available therefor.
  6. Reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for a public undertaking, improvement or
  system but only to the extent that reimbursements to the general fund are in fact made
  from the net revenue, or net user tax receipts, or combination of both, as determined for
  the immediately preceding fiscal year.
  7. Reimbursable general obligation bonds issued by the State for any political subdivision,
  whether issued before or after the effective date of this section, but only for as long as
  reimbursement by the political subdivision to the State for the payment of principal and
  interest on such bonds is required by law; provided that in the case of bonds issued after
  the effective date of this section, the consent of the governing body of the political 
  subdivision has first been obtained; and provided further that during the period that such
  bonds are excluded by the State, the principal amount then outstanding shall be included
  within the funded debt of such political subdivision.
  8. Bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under which the State or any political
  subdivision incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor, but only to the extent the principal
  amount of such bonds does not exceed seven percent of the principal amount of
  outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under this section; provided
  that the State or political subdivision shall establish and maintain a reserve in an amount in
  reasonable proportion to the outstanding loans guaranteed by the State or political
  subdivision as provided by law.
  9. Bonds issued by or on behalf of the State or by any political subdivision to meet
  appropriations for any fiscal period in anticipation of the collection of revenues for such
  period or to meet casual deficits or failures of revenue, if required to be paid within one
  year, and bonds issued by or on behalf of the State to suppress insurrection, to repel
  invasion, to defend the State in war or to meet emergencies caused by disaster or act of  
  God.
       The total outstanding indebtedness of the State or funded debt of any political
  subdivision and the exclusions therefrom permitted by this section shall be made annually
  and certified by law or as provided by law. For the purposes of section 12 and this section,
  amounts received from on-street parking may be considered and treated as revenues of a
  parking undertaking.
       Nothing in section 12 or in this section shall prevent the refunding of any bond at any
  time.
