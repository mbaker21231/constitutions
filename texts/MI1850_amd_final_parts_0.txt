[Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated (M.C.L.A.) has an incorrect Joint Resolution number for
this 1899 amendment.  M.C.L.A. lists the legislation as J.R. No.6, which was a proposed
amendment from the 1899 legislative session that would have also altered article 6 of the 1850
constitution.  However, J.R. No.6 would have overhauled the judicial department by amending
sections 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 and 20 of article 6.  This proposed amendment was rejected in
April 1899 by a vote of 102,269 to 99,391.  See Thorpe Vol. IV, p.1972 for the vote totals.  The
correct legislation is actually J.R. No.3 from the 1899 legislative session.  It was approved by the
