ORDINANCE

                           Be it ordained by the convention assembled to form a constitution for the State of
Michigan, in behalf and by authority of the people of said State, That the following propositions
be submitted to the Congress of the United States, which, if assented to by that body, shall be
obligatory on this State:

                           1. Section numbered sixteen in every surveyed township of the public lands, and,
where such section has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as
contiguous as may be, shall be granted to the State for the use of schools.

                            2. The seventy-two sections of land set apart and reserved for the use and support
of a university, by an act of Congress approved on the twentieth day of May, eighteen hundred
and twenty-six, entitled "An act concerning a seminary of learning in the Territory of Michigan,"
shall, together with such further quantities as may be agreed upon by Congress, be conveyed to
the State, and shall be appropriated solely to the use and support of such university, in such
manner as the legislature may prescribe.

                            3. Four entire sections of land, to be selected under the direction of the legislature,
from any of the unappropriated lands belonging to the United States, shall be granted to the State
for its use in establishing a seat of government.

thereof "township or ward."

[Ratified in 1839.  Amended language of Section 1, Article II reads: In all elections, every white
male citizen above the age of twenty-one years, having resided in the State six months next
preceding any election, shall be entitled to vote at such election; and every white male inhabitant
of the age aforesaid, who may be a resident of the State at the time of the signing of this

That the constitution of this State be so amended that every law authorizing the borrowing of
money or the issuing of State stocks, whereby a debt shall be created on the credit of the State,
shall specify the object for which the money shall be appropriated; and that every such law shall
embrace no more than one such object, which shall be simply and specifically stated, and that no
such law shall take effect until it shall be submitted to the people at the next general election, and
be approved by a majority of the votes cast for and against it at such election; that all money to
be raised by the authority of such law be applied to the specific object stated in such law, and to
no other purpose except the payment of such debt thereby created.  This provision shall not
extend or apply to any law to raise money for defraying the actual expenses of the legislature, the
judicial and State officers, for suppressing insurrection, repelling invasion, or defending the State
in times of war.

[Ratified in November, 1843.  According to the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1850,
this amendment did not appear to be approved by the legislature as the 1835 Constitution
required.  The 1850 constitutional convention report explains this anomaly largely as a
procedural deficiency.  The 1850 report concludes that while the amendment was enacted it did
not follow formal constitutional guidelines.]

representatives shall be chosen annually on the first Tuesday of November, by the electors of the
several counties or districts into which the State shall be divided for that purpose."

[Ratified in November, 1844.  Complete text of Section 4, Article IV reads: "The representatives
shall be chosen annually on the first Tuesday of November, by the electors of the several counties
or districts into which the State shall be divided for that purpose.  Each organized county shall be
entitled to at least one representative; but no county hereafter organized shall be entitled to a
separate representative, until it shall have attained a population equal to the ratio of
representation hereafter established."]

The legislature of this State for the year eighteen hundred and fifty shall provide by law for the
election by the people of the following officers, viz: "Judges of the Supreme Court, who shall be
ineligible to any other than a judicial office during the term for which they are elected, and for
one year thereafter; Auditor General, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attorney General,
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Prosecuting Attorneys; and the said judges are
prohibited from receiving any fees of office or other compensation than their salaries, for any
civil duties performed by them."

[No effective date available.  This fourth amendment to the 1835 constitution has also been
overlooked by Thorpe and the Michigan State Code history section.  The source of the
amendment comes from the 1850 Michigan Constitutional Convention. The 1850 convention
report claims that this amendment was proposed in 1848, referred to the legislature in 1849,
agreed to by two-thirds of the members and then submitted to the people.  It was ratified at the
November 1849 election, but no effective date is listed.  It therefore appears that this amendment
became law for at least a time before the 1850 Michigan constitution took effect.]
