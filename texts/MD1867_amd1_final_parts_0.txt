shall be taken to mean the City of Baltimore or any of the Counties of this State.

SEC. 5. Amendments to any charter adopted by the City of Baltimore or by any County of this
State

Baltimore or the
President of the County Council, and when so proposed shall be submitted to the voters of said
City or
County at the next general or congressional election occurring after the passage of said
resolution, or
the filing of said petition; and if at said election the majority of the votes cast for and against said
amendment shall be in favor thereof, said amendment shall be adopted and become a part of the
charter of said City or County from and after the thirtieth day after said election. Said

compensation, powers and duties of the County Commissioners in each County, and the power to
make changes in Sections 1 to 6 inclusive, Article XI of this Constitution, when expressly
granted as
hereinbefore provided, are hereby transferred to the voters of each County and the voters of City
of
Baltimore, respectively, provided that said powers so transferred shall be exercised only by the
adoption or amendment of a charter as hereinbefore provided; and provided further that this
Article
shall not be construed to authorize the exercise of any powers in excess of those conferred by the
Legislature upon said Counties or City as this Article sets forth.

SEC. 7. The word "Petition" as used in this Article means one or more sheets written or printed,
or
partly written and partly printed; "Signature" means the signature of a registered voter written by
himself
in his own handwriting (and not by his mark), together with the ward or district and precinct in
which he
is registered. The authenticity of such signatures and the fact that the persons so signing are
registered
voters shall be evidenced by the affidavit of one or more registered voters of the City or County
in
which said voters so signing are registered, and one affidavit may apply to or cover any number
of
signatures to such petition. The false signing of any name, or the signing of any fictitious name
to said
petition shall be forgery,' and the making of any false affidavit in connection with said petition
shall be
perjury.

[Act of 1916, CHAPTER 159. Ratified 1916]

SEC. 52.    The General Assembly shall not appropriate any money out of the Treasury except in
accordance with the following provisions: 

Sub-Section A:

Every appropriation bill shall be either a Budget Bill, or a Supplementary Appropriation Bill, as
hereinafter mentioned. 

Sub-Section B:

First. Within twenty days after the convening of the General Assembly (except in the case of a
newly
elected Governor, and then within thirty days after his inauguration), unless such time shall be
extended
by the General Assembly for the session at which the Budget is to be submitted, the Governor
shall
submit to the General Assembly two budgets, one for each of the ensuing fiscal years. Each
budget shall
contain a complete plan of proposed expenditures and . estimated revenues for the particular
fiscal year
to which it relates; and shall show the estimated surplus or deficit of revenues at the end of such
year.
Accompanying each budget shall be a statement showing: (1) the revenues and expenditures for
each of
the two fiscal years next preceding; (2) the current assets, liabilities, reserves and surplus or
deficit of
the State; (3) the debts and funds of the State; (4) an estimate of the State's financial condition as
of the

for
the General Assembly as certified to the Governor in the manner hereinafter provided; (2) for the
Executive Department; (3) for the Judiciary Department, as provided by law, certified to the
Governor
by the Comptroller; (4) to pay and discharge the principal and interest of the debt of the State of
Maryland in conformity with Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, and all laws enacted in
pursuance thereof; (5) for the salaries payable by the State under the Constitution and laws of the

estimates of appropriations.

The Governor shall deliver to the presiding officer of each house the budgets and a bill for all the
proposed appropriations of the budgets clearly itemized and classified; and the presiding officer
of each
house shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and such bill shall be known as the
"Budget Bill." The Governor may, before final action thereon by the General Assembly amend or
supplement either of said budgets to correct an oversight or in case of an emergency, with the
consent
of the General Assembly by delivering such an amendment or supplement to the presiding
officers of
both houses; and such amendment or supplement shall thereby become a part of said budget bill
as an
addition to the items of said bill or as a modification of or a substitute for any item of said bill
such
amendment or supplement may affect.

The General Assembly shall not amend the budget bill so as to affect either the obligations of the
State
under Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, or the provision made by the laws of the State
for
the establishment and maintenance of a system of public schools, or the payment of any salaries
required to be paid by the State of Maryland by the Constitution thereof; and the General
Assembly
may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the items therein relating to the General
Assembly, and
by increasing the items therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may
sot
alter the said bill except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary
or
compensation of any public officer shall not be decreased during his term of office; and such bill
when
and as passed by both houses shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.

Fourth. The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments, boards, officers and
commissions of the State expending or applying for State's moneys, as have been designated by
the
Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested by either house of the
Legislature, it
shall be their duty to appear and be heard with respect to any budget bill during the consideration
thereof, and to answer inquiries relative thereto. 

Sub-Section C: Supplementary Appropriation Bills:

Neither house shall consider other appropriations until the Budget Bill has been finally acted
upon by
both houses, and no such other appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the
provisions
following: (1) Every such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some
single work,
object or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (a) Each
Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation
thereby
made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be laid and collected as shall be directed in said Bill; (3) No
Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless it be passed in each house by a vote
of a
majority of the whole number of the members elected; and the yeas and nays recorded on its final
passage; (4) Each Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the
State as
provided in Section 17 of Article II of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said
Section
shall apply.
Nothing in this amendment shall be construed as preventing the Legislature from passing at any
time in
accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of Article III of the Constitution and subject to the
Governor's power of approval as provided in Section 17 of Article II of the Constitution an
appropriation bill to provide for the payment of any obligation of the State of Maryland within
the
protection of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States. 

Sub-Section D: General Provisions:

First. If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature three days
before the
expiration of its regular session, the Governor may, and it shall be MB duty to issue a
proclamation
extending the session for such farther period as may in his judgment be necessary for the passage
of
such Bill; but no other matter than such Bill shall be considered during such extended session
except a
provision for the cost thereof.

Second. The Governor for the purpose of making up his budgets shall have the power, and it
shall be
his duty, to re-quire from the proper State officials, including herein all executive departments,
all
executive and administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies expending or
supervising the expenditure of, and all institutions applying for State moneys and appropriations,
such
itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as he shall direct. The
estimates
for the legislative department, certified by the presiding officer of each house, of the judiciary, as
provided by law, certified by the Comptroller, and for the public schools, as provided by law,
shall be
transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as he shall direct, and shall be
included in
the budget without revision.

The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may require the attendance at
such
hearings of representatives of all agencies, and of all institutions applying for State moneys.
After such
public hearings he may in his discretion revise all estimates except those for the legislative and
judiciary
departments, and for the public schools as provided by law.

Third. The Legislature may, from time to time, enact such laws, not inconsistent with this
Section, as
may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.

Fourth. In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this Section and any
of the
other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section shall prevail. But nothing
herein shall
in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution or of any laws
heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor
from
calling extraordinary sessions of the Legislature, as pro-vided by Section 16 of Article II, or as
preventing the Legislature at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency
appropriation
or appropriations.

If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this Section shall be held
invalid
upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality of the Bill or of any other item of
such Bill or
Bills.
