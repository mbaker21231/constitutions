                 CONSTITUTION OF DELAWARE-1792

*** ASTART 9001.0 DE 1792 ***
*** SSTART 001.00 9001.0 0 DE 1792 ***

We, the people, hereby ordain and establish this constitution of government for the State of
Delaware.

Through divine goodness all men have, by nature, the rights of worshipping and serving their
Creator according to the dictates of their consciences, of enjoying and defending life and liberty,
of acquiring and protecting reputation and property, and, in general, of attaining objects suitable
to their condition, without injury by one to another; and as these rights are essential to their
welfare, for the due exercise thereof, power is inherent in them; and, therefore, all just authority
in
the institutions of political society is derived from the people, and established with their consent,
to advance their happiness; and they may, for this end, as circumstances require, from time to
time, alter their constitution of government.
