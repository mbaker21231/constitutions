appointed as
herein provided, and for the third circuit and for the sixth circuit, there shall be a chief judge and
three
associate judges to be styled judges of the Circuit Court, to be elected or appointed as herein
provided.
And no two of said associate judges, for any of the said circuits, except the third and sixth
circuits shall,
at the time of their election or appointment or during the term for which they may have been
elected or
appointed, reside in the same county. If two or more persons shall be candidates for associate
judge in
the same county in any of the circuits, except the third and sixth circuits, that one only in said
county
shall be declared elected who has the highest number of votes in the circuit. In case any two
candidates
for associate judge in any of the circuits, except the third and sixth circuits, residing in the same
county
shall have an equal number of votes greater than any other candidates for associate judge in the
circuit,
it shall be the duty of the Governor to order a new election for one associate judge; but the
person
residing in any other county of the circuit and who has the highest number of votes shall be
declared
elected. The said judges shall hold not less than two terms of the Circuit Court in each of the
counties
composing their respective circuits, at such times as are now or may hereafter be prescribed to
which
jurors shall be summoned; and in those counties where only two such terms are held, two other
and
intermediate terms, to which jurors shall not be summoned; they may alter or fix the times for
holding
any or all terms, until otherwise prescribed, and shall adopt rules to the end that all business not
requiring the interposition of the jury shall be, as far as practicable, disposed of at said
intermediate
terms. One judge in each of the above circuits, including the third and sixth circuits, shall
constitute a
quorum for the transaction of any business; and the said judges or any of them may hold special
terms
of their courts, whenever in their discretion, the business of the several counties renders such
terms
necessary. The additional associate judge for the third circuit herein provided for (shall be elected
by
the qualified voters of Baltimore and Harford Counties, at the first election that shall be held in
said
counties subsequent to the adoption of this amendment, and the judge so elected) shall be subject
to the
same constitutional provisions, hold his office for the same terms of years, receive the same
compensation and have the same powers as are herein provided for the other associate judges in
the
third circuit.

The additional judge for the sixth circuit herein provided for shall be elected by the qualified
voters of
Frederick and Montgomery Counties at the first election that shall be held in said counties
subsequent
to the adoption of this amendment and none shall be appointed before that time. The judge so
elected
shall be subject to the same constitutional provisions, receive the same compensation and have
the
same powers as are herein provided for the other associate judges in the sixth circuit. The Chief
Judge
may be elected from either Frederick or Montgomery Counties, but when the Chief Judge is
elected
from Frederick County one of the associate judges shall be a resident of said County and the two
remaining associate judges shall be residents of Montgomery County and when the Chief Judge
is
elected from Montgomery County one of the associate judges shall be a resident of said
Montgomery
County and the remaining two associate judges residents of Frederick County. In case any
candidate or
candidates for associate judge at any judicial election held in the sixth, judicial circuit shall
receive
sufficient votes to cause such candidate or candidates to be declared elected, but the election of
such
candidate or candidates would cause more associate judges than herein permitted to reside in any
county of said circuit, then and in that event only that candidate or those candidates, as the case
may
be, residing in said county in the order of the votes received shall be declared elected whose
election
would provide the permitted number of associate judges from said county and the candidate or
candidates as the case may be, residing in the other county, and not similarly disqualified, who
shall
have the next highest number of votes in said election shall be declared elected. If, by reason of
such a
condition or by reason of an equal vote for two or more candidates a sufficient number of
associate
judges duly qualified as to residence as above set out should not be elected at any election in said
sixth
judicial circuit, then it shall be the duty of the Governor to order a new election for such unfilled
office
or offices.

PART V-A-PEOPLE'S  COURTS.
41-A. There is hereby created a People's Court of Baltimore City. Said Court shall consist
originally of
a Chief Judge and two Associate Judges; the number of such Judges may thereafter be increased
or
decreased by the General Assembly by law but no such decrease shall affect the term of any
Judge then
in office or his right to stand for election for further terms as hereinafter provided. The Judges of
said
Court shall have the qualifications prescribed by Section 2 of this Article and shall have
practiced law in
the City of Baltimore for a total period of at least five years; shall hold office subject to the
provisions of
Sections 3 and 4 of this Article with regard to retirement and removal from office; and shall
receive
from the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City such compensation as shall be fixed by law
by the
General Assembly, which shall not be diminished during continuance in office.

The Governor shall appoint to said Court, to take office on the first Monday of May, 1941, one
Associate Judge for a term expiring December 31, 1942, one Associate Judge for a term expiring
December 31, 1944, and a Chief Judge for a term expiring December 31, 1946; and, upon the
creation
of any additional office on said Court by increase in the number of Judges pursuant to this
Section, shall
appoint an Associate Judge for such term, not exceeding eight years and expiring on the
thirty-first day
of December immediately following a Congressional election, as the law creating such office
shall
prescribe. If any vacancy occurs during any such original term, the Governor shall appoint a
successor
to serve for the remainder of such term. After the expiration of said original terms, the terms of
office of
said Court shall be for eight years from the expiration of the preceding term, and shall be filled as
follows:

(1) Any incumbent Judge of said Court shall be eligible, at the Congressional election
immediately
preceding the expiration of his period of appointment or term, for election or re-election to
succeed
himself (a) for a full term of eight years, except as provided in (b) hereof; or (b) for the unexpired
remainder of the current eight year term, if his appointment will expire before the end of such
term. No
person other than an incumbent Judge shall be eligible for election to said Court.

(2) Whenever a vacancy shall occur on said Court from any cause the Governor shall appoint to
said
Court a Judge who shall hold office under such appointment until the thirty-first day of
December
immediately following the first Congressional election occurring six months or more after the
date of his
appointment. No Judge of said Court, who has stood for election to succeed himself and not been
elected, shall thereafter be appointed to said Court, and no Judge of said Court, who has failed to
stand
for election when eligible, shall be appointed to succeed himself.

(3) In order to qualify for election or re-election an incumbent Judge shall file with the
Supervisors of
Elections of Baltimore City not later than thirty days before the date of the applicable election a
certificate signed and duly acknowledged, stating the basis of his eligibility and the term or
remainder of
term for which he is eligible for election. Thereupon, the name of such Judge, together with a
statement
of the term or remainder of term for which he is eligible, shall be placed upon the ballot to be
used in
said City in such election, with no party designation whatever and with no opposing candidate,
with
space provided to permit any voter to cast his vote for or against the continuance in office of such
Judge; if the votes cast for the continuance in office of such Judge represent a majority of all the
votes
cast for or against his continuance in office, such Judge shall hold office for the unexpired
remainder of
the term or for the full term of eight years, as the case may be.

Unless his office shall have been abolished pursuant to this Section, each Judge of said Court
shall
continue to hold office after the expiration of his period of appointment or term until a successor
shall
qualify. As used in this Section, "Congressional election" means any of the biennial elections at
which
members of the House of Representatives are regularly chosen.

Said Court shall have such jurisdiction (which may be made exclusive as to any class or classes
of civil
cases in Baltimore City), with such right of appeal, therefrom, and the Chief Judge and Associate
Judges thereof shall have such powers and duties, as the General Assembly shall prescribe from
time to
time by law. The Judges of said Court shall have full power to regulate by rules the
administration,
procedure and practice of said Court; such rules shall have the force of law until rescinded or
modified
by said Judges or the General Assembly. Unless otherwise provided by law, (1) all powers
granted by
this Section or by law to said Court or the Judges thereof as a body may be exercised by a
majority of
the Judges thereof, and (2) said Court shall not be a Court of Record.

There shall be a Chief Constable of said Court, who shall perform therein the duties prescribed
for
Clerks of Court by Section 10 of this Article and such other duties as shall be prescribed by law
or by
rule of said Court. Such Chief Constable shall be appointed, in the manner hereinafter prescribed,
by
the Judges of said Court; and such Chief Constable shall appoint, in the manner hereinafter
prescribed,
all original, subsequent and additional constables and clerks employed pursuant to this Section,
and
shall supervise and direct the work of all such constables and clerks. There shall be appointed

21. For each of the said circuits, excepting the eighth, the second, the third (and) the sixth and the
seventh, there shall be a chief judge and two associate judges, to be styled judges of the Circuit
Court,
to be selected or appointed as herein provided, and for the second circuit, the third circuit, (and)
the
sixth circuit, and the seventh circuit, there shall be a chief judge and three associate judges to be
styled
judges of the Circuit Court, to be elected or appointed as herein provided. And no two of said
associate judges, for any of the said circuits, except the third and sixth and seventh circuits shall,
at the
time of their election or appointment or during the term for which they may have been elected or
appointed, reside in the same county. If two or more persons shall be candidates for associate
judge in
the same county in any of the circuits, except the third and sixth and seventh circuits, that one
only in
said county shall be declared elected who has the highest number of votes in the circuit. In case
any two
candidates for associate judge in any of the circuits, except the third and sixth and seventh
circuits,
residing in the same county shall have an equal number of votes greater than any other
candidates for
associate judge in the circuit, it shall be the duty of the Governor to order a new election for one
associate judge; but the person residing in any other county of the circuit and who has the highest
number of votes shall be declared elected. The said judges shall hold not less than two terms of
the
Circuit Court in each of the counties composing their respective circuits, at such times as are now
or
may hereafter be prescribed to which jurors shall be summoned; and in those counties where
only two
such terms are held, two other and intermediate terms, to which jurors shall not be summoned;
they
may alter or fix the times for holding any or all terms, until otherwise prescribed, and shall adopt
rules to
the end that all business not requiring the interposition of the jury shall be, as far as practicable,
disposed of at said intermediate terms. One judge in each of the above circuits, including the
second,
the third (and) sixth and seventh circuits, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any
business;
and the said judges or any of them may hold special terms of their courts, whenever in their
discretion
the business of the several counties renders such terms necessary. The additional associate judge
for the
third circuit elected in accordance with the terms of the Constitutional Amendment heretofore
submitted
and adopted shall be subject to the same constitutional provisions, hold his office for the same
term of
years, receive the same compensation and have the same powers as are herein provided for the
other
associate judges in the third circuit.

The additional associate judge for the second circuit herein provided for shall be a resident of
Cecil
County, shall be appointed by the Governor after the expiration of six (6) months after the
adoption of
this amendment and shall serve until the first general election for members of the General
Assembly that
shall be held in said circuit subsequent to the adoption of this amendment, at which election his
successor shall be elected by the qualified voters of Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's, and
Talbot
Counties, constituting the second circuit. The judge so appointed shall be subject to the same
constitutional provisions, receive the same compensation and have the same powers as are herein
provided for the other associate judges in the second circuit, and the judge so elected shall be
subject
to the same constitutional provision, hold his office for the same term of years, receive the same
compensation and have the same powers as are herein provided for the other associate judges in
the
second circuit.

The additional judge for the sixth circuit herein pro-provided for and elected by the qualified
voters of
Frederick and Montgomery Counties at the 1938 election in accordance with the terms of the
Constitutional Amendment heretofore submitted and adopted shall be subject to the same
constitutional
provisions, receive the same compensation and have the same powers as 'are herein provided for
the
other associate judges in the sixth circuit and his successors shall be appointed and/or elected in
accordance with the constitutional provisions relating to judges. The Chief Judge may be elected
from
either Frederick or Montgomery Counties, but when the Chief Judge is elected from Frederick
County
one of the associate judges shall be a resident of said county and the two remaining associate
judges
shall be residents of Montgomery County and when the Chief Judge is elected from Montgomery
County one of the associate judges shall be a resident of said Montgomery County and the
remaining
two associate judges residents of Frederick County. In case any candidate or candidates for
associate
judge at any judicial election held in the sixth judicial circuit shall receive sufficient votes to
cause such
candidate or candidates to be declared elected, but the election of such candidate or candidates
would
cause more associate judges than herein permitted to reside in any county of said circuit, then
and in
that event only that candidate or those candidates, as the case may be, residing in said county in
the
order of the votes received shall be declared elected whose election would provide the permitted
number of associate judges from said county and the candidate or candidates, as the case may be,
residing in the other county, and not similarly disqualified, who shall have the next highest
number of
votes in said election shall be declared elected. If, by reason of such a condition or by reason of
an
equal vote for two or more candidates a sufficient number of associate judges duly qualified as to
residence as above set out should not be elected at any election in said sixth judicial circuit, then
it shall
be the duty of the Governor to order a new election for such unfilled office or offices.

The additional associate judge for the seventh circuit herein provided for shall be appointed by
the
Governor immediately after the adoption of this amendment and shall serve until the first general
election
for members of the General Assembly that shall be held in said circuit subsequent to the adoption
of this
amendment, at which election his successor shall be elected by the qualified voters of Prince
George's,
Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's Counties. No member of the General Assembly of 1939,
otherwise
qualified, shall be ineligible for appointment or election as such associate judge by reason of his
membership in the General Assembly. The judge so appointed shall be subject to the same
constitutional provisions, receive the same compensation and have the same powers as are herein
provided for the other associate judges in the seventh circuit, and the judge so elected and his
successors shall subject to the same constitutional provisions, hold office for the same term of
years,
receive the same compensation, and have the same powers as are herein provided for the other
associate judges in the seventh circuit. No two of the associate judges for the seventh circuit shall
at the
time of their election or appointment or during the term for which they may have been elected or
appointed reside in the same county, except in Prince George's County, in which county two of
said
associate judges for the said circuit shall reside at the time of their appointment or election and
during
the term for which they may have been appointed or elected unless the chief judge of said circuit
shall
already reside in said county, in which event only one of said associate judges shall reside in
Prince
George's County and Prince George's County shall at all times have two resident Judges and no
more,
such Judges to be either the Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit and one associate Judge or two
associate Judges of said Circuit. In case any candidate or candidates for associate judge at any
judicial
election held in the seventh judicial circuit shall receive sufficient votes to cause such candidate
or
candidates to be elected, but the election of such candidate or candidates would cause more
associate
judges than herein permitted to reside in any county of said circuit, then and in that event only
that
candidate or those candidates, as the case may be, residing in said county in the order of the votes
received shall be declared elected whose election would provide the permitted number of
associate
judges from said county and the candidate or candidates, as the case may be, residing in some
other
county, and not similarly disqualified, who shall have the next highest number of votes in said
election
shall be declared elected. If, by reason of such a condition or by reason of an equal vote for two
or
more candidates a sufficient number of associate judges duly qualified as to residence as above
set out
should not be elected at any election in said seventh judicial circuit, then it shall be the duty of
the
Governor to order a new election for such unfilled office or offices.

counties
composing their respective circuits, at such times as are now or may hereafter be prescribed to

provided for the other associate judges in the second circuit, and the judge so elected shall be
subject
to the same constitutional provision, hold his office for the same term of years, receive the same
compensation, and have the same powers as are herein provided for the other associate judges in

The additional judge for the sixth circuit herein provided for and elected by the qualified voters

XI-B.  BALTIMORE REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION.

SECTION 1. The General Assembly of Maryland, by public local law, may authorize the Mayor
and
City Council of Baltimore to create a Baltimore Redevelopment Commission. Any public local
law
authorizing the creation of the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall contain the
following
provisions :

(a) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall come into being only when the City
Council of
Baltimore shall pass a resolution that there is need for the establishment of such a Commission in
the
City of Baltimore. When the City Council of Baltimore adopts such a resolution, it shall
promptly notify
the Mayor of Baltimore City of such adoption. Upon receiving such notice and approving said
resolution, the Mayor shall appoint five persons (or such additional number of persons as the
General
Assembly may provide in said public local law), as Commissioners of the Baltimore
Redevelopment
Commision. The Commissioners shall serve for such terms' and shall receive such compensation
the
General Assembly may provide in said public local law.

(b) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission, when created, shall have power and authority to
acquire land in slums and blighted areas in Baltimore City by purchase, lease or condemnation,
and to
reconvey any such land by sale or lease for redevelopment, in accordance with a redevelopment
plan
for Baltimore City, provided that such redevelopment plan has first been approved by the
Commission
on City Plan of Baltimore City; and provided further that no such slum or blighted area to be
acquired
shall be less than eight acres or more than eighty acres. The term "slum" shall mean any area
where
dwellings predominate, which by reason of depreciation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or
design,
lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or any combination of these factors, are detrimental
to the
public safety, health or morals. The term "blighted area" shall mean an area in which a majority
of the
buildings have declined in productivity by reason of obsolescence, depreciation or other causes
to an
extent they no longer justify fundamental repairs and adequate maintenance.

(c) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have authority to use the power of eminent
domain
to acquire any land needed for any redevelopment project; provided, however, that the Baltimore
Redevelopment Commission shall have first obtained options upon or shall have purchased at
least 50
percentum of such land area required for any such redevelopment project. Property already
devoted to
a public use may be acquired by the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission; provided, however,
that
no real property belonging to the State of Maryland or the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore
may
be acquired without the consent of said State or of said City, as the case may be. No property
taken by
the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission, by exercise of the power of eminent domain, shall be
taken
without just compensation, as agreed upon between the parties, or awarded by a Jury.

(d) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to petition the United States of
America for loans of money and to receive from the United States of America such loans to be
used in
the acquisition of land in slums and blighted areas for redevelopment and for use in the
preparation of
any redevelopment plan.

(e) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to reconvey any land acquired
by it,
either by purchase, lease or condemnation to any private corporations, companies, partnerships,
or
persons, for redevelopment and rebuilding, at a price consistent with the new uses which the
Commission on City Plan 'shall prescribe for such land, even though such price may be below
the
original cost of acquisition. The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to
include in
the terms of sale or leases of land to private corporations, companies, partnerships, or persons,
provisions obligating the purchasers or lessees of such land to begin the building of
improvements within
a reasonable period of time; and to include in such contracts, appropriate covenants and
restrictions to
maintain standards- of population density, property maintenance, character of the use of land,
and
architectural standards established in the redevelopment plan and approved by the Commission
on City
Plan of Baltimore City.

(f) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have no power to pledge the credit of, or in
any
way bind the Mayor City Council of Baltimore, and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore
shall not
be liable in any way or manner whatsoever, for any of the obligations, contracts, or undertakings

XI-B.  BALTIMORE REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION.

SECTION 1. The General Assembly of Maryland, by public local law, may authorize the Mayor
and
City Council of Baltimore to create a Baltimore Redevelopment Commission. Any public local
law
authorizing the creation of the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall contain the
following
provisions :

(a) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall come into being only when the City
Council of
Baltimore shall pass a resolution that there is need for the establishment of such a Commission in
the
City of Baltimore. When the City Council of Baltimore adopts such a resolution, it shall
promptly notify
the Mayor of Baltimore City of such adoption. Upon receiving such notice and approving said
resolution, the Mayor shall appoint five persons (or such additional number of persons as the
General
Assembly may provide in said public local law), as Commissioners of the Baltimore
Redevelopment
Commision. The Commissioners shall serve for such terms' and shall receive such compensation
the
General Assembly may provide in said public local law.

(b) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission, when created, shall have power and authority to
acquire land in slums and blighted areas in Baltimore City by purchase, lease or condemnation,
and to
reconvey any such land by sale or lease for redevelopment, in accordance with a redevelopment
plan
for Baltimore City, provided that such redevelopment plan has first been approved by the
Commission
on City Plan of Baltimore City; and provided further that no such slum or blighted area to be
acquired
shall be less than eight acres or more than eighty acres. The term "slum" shall mean any area
where
dwellings predominate, which by reason of depreciation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or
design,
lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or any combination of these factors, are detrimental
to the
public safety, health or morals. The term "blighted area" shall mean an area in which a majority
of the
buildings have declined in productivity by reason of obsolescence, depreciation or other causes
to an
extent they no longer justify fundamental repairs and adequate maintenance.

(c) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have authority to use the power of eminent
domain
to acquire any land needed for any redevelopment project; provided, however, that the Baltimore
Redevelopment Commission shall have first obtained options upon or shall have purchased at
least 50
percentum of such land area required for any such redevelopment project. Property already
devoted to
a public use may be acquired by the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission; provided, however,
that
no real property belonging to the State of Maryland or the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore
may
be acquired without the consent of said State or of said City, as the case may be. No property
taken by
the Baltimore Redevelopment Commission, by exercise of the power of eminent domain, shall be
taken
without just compensation, as agreed upon between the parties, or awarded by a Jury.

(d) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to petition the United States of
America for loans of money and to receive from the United States of America such loans to be
used in
the acquisition of land in slums and blighted areas for redevelopment and for use in the
preparation of
any redevelopment plan.

(e) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to reconvey any land acquired
by it,
either by purchase, lease or condemnation to any private corporations, companies, partnerships,
or
persons, for redevelopment and rebuilding, at a price consistent with the new uses which the
Commission on City Plan 'shall prescribe for such land, even though such price may be below
the
original cost of acquisition. The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have power to
include in
the terms of sale or leases of land to private corporations, companies, partnerships, or persons,
provisions obligating the purchasers or lessees of such land to begin the building of
improvements within
a reasonable period of time; and to include in such contracts, appropriate covenants and
restrictions to
maintain standards- of population density, property maintenance, character of the use of land,
and
architectural standards established in the redevelopment plan and approved by the Commission
on City
Plan of Baltimore City.

(f) The Baltimore Redevelopment Commission shall have no power to pledge the credit of, or in
any
way bind the Mayor City Council of Baltimore, and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore
shall not
be liable in any way or manner whatsoever, for any of the obligations, contracts, or undertakings
of the
Baltimore Redevelopment Commission.

purposes of
this section, be designated as the Fourth Appellate Judicial Circuit. The additional Judge from
the
Fourth Appellate Judicial Circuit shall be appointed by the Governor to serve until the election
and
qualification of his successor, as provided by Section 5 of this Article. Except as to such
.additional
Judge, the Judges of said Court, in the first instance, shall be appointed by the Governor from

respective appellate Judicial Circuits but such appointments shall be made from among the
elected
Judges composing the Court of Appeals as of December 31, 1944. If, on December 31, 1944,
there
are no elected members of the Court of Appeals from any Appellate Judicial Circuit, the
Governor shall
designate the member of the Court of Appeals from that Appellate Judicial Circuit from among
the
appointed members of the Court of Appeals from that Appellate Judicial Circuit. If any Judge so
appointed shall be a member of the Court of Appeals as of December 31, 1944, by virtue of
having
been elected to that office, his appointment shall be for the balance of the term for which he had
theretofore been elected. The Judges so appointed from the First, Second and Third Appellate
Judicial
Circuits shall cease to be Chief Judges of their respective Circuits. Any elected Judges from

except the Eighth Circuit, in office on December 31, 1944, other than the three designated by the
Governor as Judges of the Court of Appeals, shall be additional Judges of the Court of Appeals
and
shall continue to be Chief Judges of their respective Circuits and shall hold office for the residue
of the
terms for which they were elected. No successor to any such additional Judge shall be appointed
or
elected as Judge of the Court of Appeals or (except as .provided in Section 21 of this Article) as
Judge
of his Circuit, but any such additional Judge shall be eligible to appointment as the member of
the Court
of Appeals from his respective Appellate Judicial Circuit. Any vacancy in any Appellate Judicial
Circuit
shall be filled by designation by the Governor of one of the additional Judges from such
Appellate
Judicial Circuit, if any, to hold office for the residue of the term for which he was originally
elected.
Upon his appointment or designation as a member of the Court of Appeals from his Appellate
Judicial
Circuit, such additional Judge shall cease to be the Chief Judge of his Circuit. The Judges of the
Court
of Appeals shall be elected by the qualified voters of their respective Appellate Judicial Circuits,
their
terms to begin on the date of their qualification. One of the judges of the Court of Appeals shall
be
designated by the Governor as the Chief Judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals shall be
co-extensive with the limits of the State and such as now is or may hereafter be prescribed by
law. It
shall hold its sessions in the City of Annapolis on the second Monday in January in the year
1945, and
thereafter at such time or times as it shall from time to time by rule prescribe. Its session or
sessions
shall continue not less than ten months in each year, if the business before it shall so require, and
it shall
be competent for the judges temporarily to transfer their sittings elsewhere upon sufficient cause.
The
salary of each judge of the Court of Appeals shall be that now or hereafter prescribed by the
General
Assembly and shall not be diminished during his continuance in office. When the number of
judges shall
have become reduced to five, three of the judges shall constitute a quorum, and the concurrence
of a
majority of a quorum shall be sufficient for the decision of any cause.

Sec. 21. From and after January 1, 1945, there shall be at least three judges for the first, second,
third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh circuits, to be styled judges of the Circuit Court, to be elected or
appointed as herein provided. In any of said circuits in which there shall be more than three
judges
(including the additional judge of the Court of Appeals), no successor to the additional judge of
the
Court of Appeals shall be appointed or elected as judge of said circuit. In any of said circuits in
which
there shall be only three judges (including an additional judge of the Court of Appeals), a
successor to
the additional judge of the Court of Appeals shall be appointed and elected as judge of said
circuit. The
aforesaid number of judges for any of the circuits shall be subject to increase or decrease by law
as
provided in Section 5 of this Article. The senior judge in length of service shall be the chief
judge of the
circuit (unless there is an additional judge of the Court of Appeals) ; the other judge or judges
shall be
associate judges. No two of said judges of the Circuit Court shall at the time of their election or
appointment, or during the term for which they may have been elected or appointed, reside in any
one
county other than Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince George's or Allegany County, and not more
than two
in any county except (if there is an additional judge of the Court of Appeals) Baltimore County.
In case
any candidate or candidates for judge at any election shall receive sufficient votes to cause such
candidate or candidates to be declared elected, but the election of such candidate or candidates
would
cause more judges than herein permitted to reside in any county of the circuit, then and in that
event
there shall be declared elected only that candidate or those candidates residing in said county, in
the
order of the votes received, whose election would provide the permitted number of judges from
said
county, and also the candidate or candidates residing in some other county, and not similarly
disqualified, who shall have the next highest number of votes in said election. If, by reason of
such a
condition or by reason of an equal vote for two or more candidates a sufficient number of judges
duly
qualified as to residence shall not be elected at any election, then it shall be the duty of the
Governor to
order a new election for such unfilled office or offices. The said judges shall hold such terms of
the
Circuit Court in each of the counties composing their respective circuits, at such times, as are
now
prescribed or may hereafter be prescribed by rules or regulations by the Court of Appeals or
otherwise
by law. One judge in each of said seven circuits shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
any
business; and the said judges, or any of them, may hold special terms of their Courts, when in
their
discretion, the business of the several counties renders such terms necessary.

All provisions of the Constitution of Maryland and all acts of the General Assembly relating to
the Court
of Appeals or any other courts, and all rules heretofore adopted by the Court of Appeals, not
inconsistent with the provisions of the sections amended or added by this amendment, shall
remain in
full force and effect unless and until amended or repealed by proper authority. All salaries now
prescribed by law for associate judges of the Circuit Courts shall continue to apply to all judges
(including chief judges) of the Circuit Courts who are not judges of the Court of Appeals. No
member
of the General Assembly at which this amendment was proposed, if otherwise qualified, shall be
ineligible for appointment or election as judge of the Court of Appeals or any other court by
reason of
his membership in such General Assembly. All appeals and other matters pending in the Court of
Appeals on January 1, 1945, shall be proceeded with and determined by the Court as hereby

when
and as passed by both Houses, shall be a law immediately without further action by the
Governor.

(7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments, boards, officers and
commissions of the State expending or applying for State's moneys, as have been designated by

Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be heard with respect to any Budget Bill during the
consideration thereof, and to answer inquiries relative thereto.

separate bill limited to some single .work, object or purpose therein stated and called herein a
Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the
revenue
necessary to pay the appropriation thereby made a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and

the
yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall be
presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution
and
thereafter all the provisions of said section shall apply.

(9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General Assembly from passing
at any
time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of Article 3 of the Constitution and subject
to the
Governor's power of approval as provided in Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution, an
appropriation bill to provide for the payment of any obligation of the State within the protection
of
Section 10 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.

(10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature three days before
the
expiration of its regular session, the Governor may, and it shall be his duty to issue a
proclamation
extending the session for some further period as may, in his judgment, be necessary for the
passage of
such bill; but no other matter than such bill shall be considered during such extended session
except a
provision for the cost thereof.

(11) The Governor for the purpose of making up his Budget shall have the power, and it shall be
his
duty, to require from the proper State officials, including herein all executive departments, all
executive
and administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies, expending or supervising
the
expenditure of, and all institutions applying for State moneys and appropriations, such itemized
estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as he shall direct. The estimates
for the
Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer of each House, of the Judiciary, as
provided
by law, certified by the Comptroller, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as he shall direct, and shall be
included in
the Budget without revision.

(12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may require the
attendance at
such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all institutions applying for State
moneys. After
such public hearings he may, in his discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative
and
judiciary departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law.               

(13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not inconsistent with this
section,
as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.

(14) In the event of any inconsistency between- any of the provisions of this Section and any of
the
other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section shall prevail. But nothing
herein shall
in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws
heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor
from
calling extraordinary sessions of the General Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2,
or as
preventing the General Assembly at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency
appropriation or appropriations.

(15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this Section shall be held
invalid
upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality of the bill or of any other item of
such bill or
bills.

[CHAPTER 65 (Senate Bill 71)]

21. From and after December 1, 1954, there shall be at least three judges for the first, second,
third,
fourth, fifth, and seventh circuits, and at least four judges in the sixth circuit to be styled judges
of the
Circuit Court to be elected or appointed as herein provided. The aforesaid number of judges for
any of
the circuits shall be subject to increase or decrease by the General Assembly . The senior judge in
length of service shall be the chief judge of the circuit; the other judge or judges shall be
associate
judges. No two of said judges of the Circuit Court shall at the time of their election or
appointment, or
during the terms for which they may have been elected or appointed, reside in any one county
other
than Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince George's or Allegany County and not more than two in any
county
except Baltimore County; and except further that after December 1, 1954, there shall be not less
than
three judges of the Circuit Court in Montgomery County and the vacancy hereby created shall be
filled
as provided in Section 5 of this Article. In case any candidate or candidates for judge at any
election
shall receive sufficient votes to cause such candidate or candidates to be declared elected, but the
election of such candidate or candidates could cause more judges than permitted by law to reside
in
any county of the circuit then and in that event there shall be declared elected only that candidate
or
those candidates residing in said county, in the order of the votes received, whose election would
provide the permitted number of judges from said county and also the candidate or candidates
residing
in some other county, and not similarly disqualified, who shall have the next highest number of
votes in
said election. If, by reason of such a condition or by reason of an equal vote for two or more
candidates a sufficient number of judges duly qualified as to residence shall not be elected at any
election, then it shall be the duty of the Governor to order a new election for such unfilled office
or
offices. The said judges shall hold such terms of the Circuit Court in each of the counties
composing
their respective circuits, at such times, as are now prescribed or may hereafter be prescribed by
rules
or regulations by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by law. One judge in each of said seven
circuits
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business; and the said judges, or any of them,
may
hold special terms of their Courts, when in their discretion, the business of the several counties
renders
such terms necessary.
All provisions of the Constitution of Maryland and all Acts of the General Assembly relating to
the
Court of Appeals or any other Courts, and all rules heretofore adopted by the Court of Appeals,
not
inconsistent with the provisions of the sections amended or added by this amendment, shall
remain in
full force and effect unless and until amended or repealed by proper authority. All salaries now
prescribed by law for associate judges of the Circuit Courts shall continue to apply to all judges
(including chief judges) of the Circuit Courts who are not judges of the Court of Appeals. No
member
of the General Assembly at which this amendment was proposed, if otherwise qualified, shall be
ineligible for appointment or election as judge of the Court of Appeals or any other court by
reason of
his membership in such General Assembly. In the event and to the extent of any inconsistency
between
the provisions of any section amended or added by this amendment and any of the other
provisions of
this Constitution or the provisions of any existing law, the provisions of the sections amended or
added
shall prevail, and such other provisions shall be repealed or abrogated to the extent of such
inconsistency, except Section 35A of Article III of this Constitution; provided, however, that in
the
event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the sections thus amended or added and any
of
the other provisions of this Constitution as amended by any other amendments which may be
adopted
at the same tune as this amendment, i.e., at the election held in November, 1954, the changes
made by
this amendment and all such other amendments to this Constitution shall all be given effect and
further
provided that if the amendments proposed by Chapter 607 of the Acts of the General Assembly
of
Maryland of 1958 to Sections 3 and 21 of Article 4 of the Constitution of Maryland are adopted
by the
voters of the State at the election held in November, 1954, the amendments proposed herein to
said
Section 21 shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever and shall not be included in any
future
copy or edition of the Constitution of Maryland or treated in any way as if effective.

21. From and after December 1, 1954, there shall be at least three judges for the first, second,
fourth,
fifth, sixth, and seventh circuits, and at least four judges in the third circuit to be styled judges of
the
Circuit Court, to be elected or appointed as herein provided. The aforesaid number of judges for
any of
the circuits shall be subject to increase or decrease by the General Assembly.  The senior judge in
length of service shall be the chief judge of the circuit; the other judge or judges shall be
associate
judges. No two of said judges of the Circuit Court shall at the time of their election or
appointment, or
during the term for which they may have been elected or appointed, reside in any one county
other than
Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince George's or Allegany County, and not more than two in any
county
except Baltimore County. In case any candidate or candidates for judge at any election shall
receive
sufficient votes to cause such candidate or candidates to be declared elected, but the election of
such
candidate or candidates would cause more judges than herein permitted to reside in any county of
the
circuit, then and in that event there shall be declared elected only that candidate or those
candidates
residing in said county, in the order of the votes received, whose election would provide the
permitted
number of judges from said county, and also the candidate or candidates residing in some other
county,
and not similarly disqualified, who shall have the next highest number of votes in said election.
If, by
reason of such a condition or by reason of an equal vote for two or more candidates a sufficient
number
of judges duly qualified as to residence shall not be elected at any election, then it shall be the
duty of
the Governor to order a new election for such unfilled office or offices. From and after December
1,1954, there shall be not less than three judges resident in Baltimore County. Notwithstanding
any
other provision of this Article, the vacancy in Baltimore County created by the adoption of this
amendment shall not be filled by appointment as provided in Section 5 of this Article; but at the
first
biennial general election for representatives in Congress after the adoption of this amendment, a
judge
shall be elected by the qualified voters of Baltimore County to fill such vacancy. Any other
vacancy in
the office of judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County shall be filled as provided in
Sections 8
and 5 of this Article. The said judges shall hold such terms of the Circuit Court in each of the
counties
composing their respective circuits, at such times, as are now prescribed or may hereafter be
prescribed by rules or regulations by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by law. One judge in
each of

ARTICLE XIA Local Legislation

SEC. 3. Every charter so formed shall provide for an elective legislative body in which shall be
vested
the law-making power of said City or County. Such legislative body in the City of Baltimore
shall be
known as the City Council of the City of Baltimore, and in any County shall be known as the
County
Council of the County. The chief executive officer, if any such charter shall provide for the
election of
such executive officer, or the presiding officer of said legislative body, if such charter shall not
provide
for the election of a chief executive officer, shall be known in the City of Baltimore as Mayor of
Baltimore, and in any County as the President of the County Council of the County, and all
references
in the Constitution and laws of this State to the Mayor of Baltimore and City Council of the City
of
Baltimore or to the County Commissioners of the Counties, shall be construed to refer to the
Mayor of
Baltimore and City Council of the City of Baltimore and to the President and County Council
herein
provided for whenever such construction would be reasonable. From and after the adoption of a
charter by the City of Baltimore, or any County of this State, as hereinbefore provided, the
Mayor of
Baltimore and City Council of the City of Baltimore or the County Council of said County,
subject to
the Constitution and Public General Laws of this State, shall have full power to enact local laws
of said
City or County including the power to repeal or amend local laws of said City or County enacted
by
the General Assembly, upon all matters covered by the express powers granted as above
provided;
provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize or empower the County
Council
of any County in this State to enact laws or regulations for any incorporated town, village, or
municipality in said County, on any matter covered by the powers granted to said town, village,
or
municipality by the Act incorporating it, or any subsequent Act or Acts amendatory thereto.
Provided,
however, that the charters for the various Counties shall [provide] specify the number of days,
not to
exceed forty-five, which may but need not be consecutive, that the County Council of the
Counties
[shall not] may sit [more than one month] in each year for the purpose of enacting legislation for
such
Counties, and all legislation shall be enacted [during the month] at the times so designated for
that
purpose in the charter, and all laws and ordinances so enacted shall be published once a week for
three
successive weeks in at least one newspaper published in such Counties, so that the taxpayers and
citizens may have notice thereof. This provision shall not apply to Baltimore City. All such local
laws
enacted by the Mayor of Baltimore and City Council of the City of Baltimore or the Council of
the
Counties as hereinbefore provided, shall be subject to the same rules of interpretation as those
now
applicable to the Public Local Laws of this State, except that in case of any conflict between said
local
law and any Public General Law now or hereafter enacted the Public General Law shall control.

session in
