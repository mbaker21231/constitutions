*** SSTART 001.00 9001.0 0 DE 1897 ***

We the people, hereby ordain and establish this constitution of government for the State of
Delaware.

                            PREAMBLE

Through Divine goodness, all men have by nature the rights of worshiping. and serving their
Creator according to the dictates of their consciences, of enjoying and defending life and liberty,
of acquiring and protecting reputation and property, and in general of attaining objects suitable to
their condition, without injury by one to another; and as these rights are essential to their welfare,
for the due exercise thereof, power is inherent in them; and therefore all just authority in the
institutions of political society is derived from the people, and established with their consent, to
advance their happiness; and they may for this end, as circumstances require, from time to time,
alter their Constitution of government.

cases of appeal under this section. The said judges, or a majority of them, met as aforesaid, may

majority of them, shall prescribe. From time to time hereafter, whenever a majority of all the
judges entitled to sit in the Supreme Court shall so request, all of the judges so entitled shall, as
soon as conveniently may be, meet at the usual place of sitting of said court; and they, or a
majority of them, shall have power to revise, amend, add to or annul, any rule or rules theretofore
adopted touching forms, practice or procedure in cases of appeal under this section, or arrest and

trying the case; and upon appeal no judgment of the court below shall be affirmed without the
concurrence of all of the judges of the Supreme Court sitting in the case, and their failure to
