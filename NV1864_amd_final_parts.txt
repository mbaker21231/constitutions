SECTION 3.  The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and the power to
propose amendments to the constitution and to enact or reject the same at the polls, independent
of the legislature, and also reserve the power at their option to approve or reject at the polls, in
the manner herein provided, any act, item, section or part of any act or measure passed by the
legislature, and section one of article four of the constitution shall hereafter be considered
accordingly.  The first power reserved by the people is the initiative, and not more than ten per
cent (10%) of the qualified electors shall be required to propose any measure by initiative
petition, and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed.  Initiative
petitions, for all but municipal legislation, shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than
thirty (30) days before any regular session of the legislature; the secretary of state shall transmit
the same to the legislature as soon as it convenes and organizes.  Such initiative measure shall
take precedence over all measures of the legislature except appropriation bills, and shall be
enacted or rejected by the legislature, without change or amendment, within forty (40) days.  If
any such initiative measure so proposed by petition as aforesaid, shall be enacted by the
legislature and approved by the governor in the same manner as other laws are enacted, same
shall become a law, but shall be subject to referendum petition as provided in sections one and
two of this article.  If said initiative measure be rejected by the legislature, or if no action be
taken thereon within said forty (40) days, the secretary of state shall submit the same to the
qualified electors for approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election; and if a majority
of the qualified electors voting thereon shall approve of such measure it shall become a law and
take effect from the date of the official declaration of the vote; an initiative measure so approved
by the qualified electors shall not be annulled, set aside or repealed by the legislature within three
(3) years from the date said act takes effect.  In case the legislature shall reject such initiative
measure, said body may, with the approval of the governor, propose a different measure on the
same subject, in which event both measures shall be submitted by the secretary of state to the
qualified electors for approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election.  The enacting
clause of all bills proposed by the initiative shall be: "The People of the State of Nevada do enact
as follows."  The whole number of votes cast for justice of the supreme court at the general
election last preceding the filing of any initiative petition shall be the basis on which the number
of qualified electors required to sign such petition shall be counted.  The second power reserved
by the people is the referendum, which shall be exercised in the manner provided in sections one
and two of this article.  The initiative and referendum powers in this article provided for are
further reserved to the qualified electors of each county and municipality as to all local, special
and municipal legislation of every character in or for said respective counties or municipalities. 
The legislature may provide by law for the manner ov exercising the initiative and referendum
powers as to county and municipal legislation, but shall not require a petition of more than 10 per
cent (10%) of the qualified electors to order the referendum, nor more than 15 per cent (15%) to
propose any municipal measure by initiative.  If the conflicting measures submitted to the people
at the next ensuing general election shall both be approved by a majority of the votes severally
cast for and against each of said measures, the measure receiving the highest number of
affirmative votes shall thereupon become a law as to all conflicting provisions.  The provisions
of this section shall be self-executing, but legislation may be especially enacted to facilitate its
operation.

SECTION 3.  The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and the power to
propose amendments to the constitution and to enact or reject the same at the polls, independent
of the legislature, and also reserve the power at their option to approve or reject at the polls, in
the manner herein provided, any act, item, section or part of any act or measure passed by the
legislature, and section one of article four of the constitution shall hereafter be considered
accordingly.  The first power reserved by the people is the initiative.  The initiative petition shall
be proposed by not less than ten per cent (10%) of the qualified electors of each of not less than
seventy five per cent (75%) of the counties in the state, provided, however, that the total number
of qualified electors proposing the said petition shall be not less than ten per cent (10%) of all the
qualified electors of the State.  Every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so
proposed.  Each signer shall affix thereto his or her signature, place of residence and the county
within which he or she is a qualified elector.  Each document comprising the initiative petition
filed with the Secretary of State shall have affixed thereto, an affidavit made by one of the
signers to each of said documents or to the petition, to the effect that all of the signatures are
genuine and that each and every individual who signed his or her name thereto was at the time
that he or she signed the petition a bonafide qualified elector of the respective county and the
State of Nevada, said affidavit to be executed before a Notary Public or some officer authorized
to administer an oath who possesses a seal.  Initiative petitions, for all but municipal legislation,
shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than thirty (30) days before any regular session of
the legislature; the secretary of state shall transmit the same to the legislature as soon as it
convenes and organizes.  Such initiative measure shall take precedence over all measures of the
legislature except appropriation bills, and shall be enacted or rejected by the legislature, without
change or amendment, within forty (40) days.  If any such initiative measure so proposed by
petition as aforesaid, shall be enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor in the same
manner as other laws are enacted, same shall become a law, but shall be subject to referendum
petition as provided in sections one and two of this article.  If said initiative measure be rejected
by the legislature, or if no action be taken thereon within said forty (40) days, the secretary of
state shall submit the same to the qualified electors for approval or rejection at the next ensuing
general election; and if a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon shall approve of such
measure it shall become a law and take effect from the date of the official declaration of the vote;
an initiative measure so approved by the qualified electors shall not be annulled, set aside or
repealed by the legislature within three (3) years from the date said act takes effect.  In case the
legislature shall reject such initiative measure, said body may, with the approval of the governor,
propose a different measure on the same subject, in which event both measures shall be
submitted by the secretary of state to the qualified electors for approval or rejection at the next
ensuing general election.  The enacting clause of all bills proposed by the initiative shall be: "The
people of the State of Nevada do enact as follows."  The total number of votes cast at the general
election last preceding the filing of any initiative petition shall be the basis on which the number
of qualified electors required to sign such petition shall be counted.  The second power reserved
by the people is the referendum, which shall be exercised in the manner provided in sections one
and two of this article.  The initiative and referendum powers in this article provided for are
further reserved to the qualified electors of each county and municipality as to all local, special
and municipal legislation of every character in or for said respective counties or municipalities. 
The legislature may provide by law for the manner of exercising the initiative and referendum
powers as to county and municipal legislation, but shall not requires a petition of more than 10
per cen (10%) of the qualified electors to order the referendum, nor more than 15 per cent (15%)
to propose any municipal measure by initiative.  If the conflicting measures submitted to the
people at the next ensuing general election shall both be approved by a majority of the votes
severally cast for and against each of said measures, the measure receiving the highest number of
affirmative votes shall thereupon become a law as to all conflicting provisions. The provision of
this section shall be self-executing, but legislation may be especially enacted to facilitate its
operation.

filed with the secretary of state not less than 30 days prior to any regular session of the
legislature.  The secretary of state shall transmit such petition to the legislature as soon as the
legislature convenes and organizes.  The petition shall take precedence over all other measures

submitted to the voters are both approved by a majority of the voters voting on such measures,
the measure which receives the largest number of affirmative votes shall thereupon become law.
     4.  If the initiative petition proposes an amendment to the constitution, it shall be filed
with the secretary of state not less than 60 days before any regular general election at which the
question of approval or disapproval of such amendment may be voted upon by the voters of the
entire state.  The secretary of state shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county in the state, together with any explanatory
matter which shall be placed upon the ballot, the entire text of the proposed amendment. If a
majority of the voters voting on such question at such election votes disapproval of such
amendment, no further action shall be taken on the petition.  If a majority of such voters votes
approval of such amendment, the secretary of state shall publish and resubmit the question of
approval or disapproval to a vote of the voters at the next succeeding general election in the same

State of Nevada is subject, as herein provided, to recall from office by the registered voters of the
state, or of the county, district, or municipality, from which he was elected.  For this purpose a
number of registered voters not less than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the number who actually
voted in the state or in the county, district, or municipality electing said officer, at the preceding
general election, shall file their petition, in the manner herein provided, demanding his recall by
the people; they shall set forth in said petition, in not exceeding two hundred (200) words, the
reasons why said recall is demanded.  If he shall offer his resignation, it shall be accepted and
take effect on the day it is offered, and the vacancy thereby caused shall be filled in the manner
provided by law.  If he shall not resign within five (5) days after the petition is filed, a special
election shall be ordered to be held within twenty days (20) after the issuance of the call therefor,
in the state, or county, district, or municipality electing said officer, to determine whether the
people will recall said officer.  On the ballot at said election shall be printed verbatim as set forth

another.  The recall petition shall be filed with the officer with whom the petition for nomination
to such office shall be filed, and the same officer shall order the special election when it is
required.  No such petition shall be circulated or filed against any officer until he has actually
held his office six (6) months, save and except that it may be filed against a senator or
assemblyman in the legislature at any time after ten (10) days from the beginning of the first
session after his election.  After one such petition and special election, no further recall petition
shall be filed against the same officer during the term for which he was elected, unless such
further petitioners shall pay into the public treasury from which the expenses of said special
election have been paid, the whole amount paid out of said public treasury as expenses for the
preceding special election.  Such additional legislation as may aid the operation of this section

who voted at the last preceding general election in not less than 75 percent of the counties in the
state, but the total number of registered voters signing the initiative petition shall be equal to 10
percent or more of the voters who voted in the entire state at the last preceding general election.
     3.  If the initiative petition proposes a statute or an amendment to a statute, it shall be
filed with the secretary of state not less than 30 days prior to any regular session of the
legislature.  The secretary of state shall transmit such petition to the legislature as soon as the
legislature convenes and organizes.  The petition shall take precedence over all other measures
except appropriation bills, and the statute or amendment to a statute proposed thereby shall be
enacted or rejected by the legislature without change or amendment within 40 days.  If the
proposed statute or amendment to a statute is enacted by the legislature and approved by the
governor in the same manner as other statutes are enacted, such statute or amendment to a statute
shall become law, but shall be subject to a referendum petition as provided in section 1 of this
article.  If the statute or amendment to a statute is rejected by the legislature, or if no action is
taken thereon within 40 days, the secretary of state shall submit the question of approval or
disapproval of such statute or amendment to a statute to a vote of the voters at the next
succeeding general election. If a majority of the voters voting on such question at such election
votes approval of such statute or amendment to a statute, it shall become law and take effect
upon completion of the canvass of votes by the supreme court.  An initiative measure so
approved by the voters shall not be amended, annulled, repealed, set aside or suspended by the
legislature within 3 years from the date it takes effect.  If a majority of such voters votes
disapproval of such statute or amendment to a statute, no further action shall be taken on such
petition.  If the legislature reject such proposed statute or amendment, the governor may
recommend to the legislature and the legislature may propose a different measure on the same
subject, in which event, after such different measure has been approved by the governor, the
question of approval or disapproval of each measure shall be submitted by the secretary of state
to a vote of the voters at the next succeeding general election. If the conflicting provisions
submitted to the voters are both approved by a majority of the voters voting on such measures,
the measure which receives the largest number of affirmative votes shall thereupon become law. 
     4.  If the initiative petition proposes an amendment to the constitution, it shall be filed
with the secretary of state not less than 90 days before any regular general election at which the
question of approval or disapproval of such amendment may be voted upon by the voters of the
entire state.  The secretary of state shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county in the state, together with any explanatory
matter which shall be placed upon the ballot, the entire text of the proposed amendment.  If a
majority of the voters voting on such question at such election votes disapproval of such
amendment, no further action shall be taken on the petition.  If a majority of such voters votes
approval of such amendment, the secretary of state shall publish and resubmit the question of
approval of disapproval to a vote of the voters at the next succeeding general election in the same
manner as such question was originally submitted.  If a majority of such voters votes disapproval
of such amendment, no further action shall be taken on such petition.  If a majority of such voters

provide by law for the taxation of estates taxed by the United States, but only to the extent of any
credit allowed by federal law for the payment of the state tax and only for the purpose of
education, to be divided between the common schools and the state university for their support
and maintenance.  The combined amount of these federal and state taxes may not exceed the
estate tax which would be imposed by federal law alone.  If another state of the United States
imposes and collects death taxes against an estate which is taxable by the State of Nevada under
this section, the amount of estate tax to be collected by the state of Nevada must be reduced by
the amount of the death taxes collected by the other state.  Any lien for the estate tax attaches no
sooner than the time when the tax is due and payable, and no restriction on possession or use of a
decedent's property may be imposed by law before the time when the tax is due and payable in
full under federal law.  The State of Nevada shall:
     1.  Accept the determination by the United States of the amount of the taxable estate
without further audit.
     2.  Accept payment of the tax in installments proportionate to any which may be
permitted under federal law.
     3.  Impose no penalty for such a deferred payment.
     4.  Not charge interest on a deferred or belated payment at any rate higher than may be
provided in similar circumstances by federal law.

SECTION 3.  Pledge of certain property and money, escheated estates and fines collected under
penal laws for educational purposes; apportionment and use of interest.  All lands granted by
Congress to this state for educational purposes, all estates that escheat to the state, all property
given or bequeathed to the state for educational purposes, and the proceeds derived from these
sources, together with that percentage of the proceeds from the sale of federal lands which has
been granted by Congress to this state without restriction or for educational purposes and all fines
collected under the penal laws of the state are hereby pledged for educational purposes and the
money therefrom must not be transferred to other funds for other uses.  The interest only earned
on the money derived from these sources must be apportioned by the legislature among the
several counties for educational purposes, and, if necessary, a portion of that interest may be
appropriated for the support of the state university, but any of that interest which is unexpended
at the end of any year must be added to the principal sum pledged for educational purposes.

SECTION 2.  Initiative petition for enactment or amendment of statute or amendment to
constitution.
     1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 of article 4 of this constitution, but subject
to the limitations of section 6 of this article, the people reserve to themselves the power to
propose, by initiative petition, statues and amendments to statutes and amendments to this
constitution, and to enact or reject them at the polls.  
     2.  An initiative petition shall be in the form required by section 3 of this article and shall
be proposed by a number of registered voters equal to 10 percent or more of the number of voters
who voted at the last preceding general election in not less than 75 percent of the counties in the
state, but the total number of registered voters signing the initiative petition shall be equal to 10
percent or more of the voters who voted in the entire state at the last preceding general election.
     3.  If the initiative petition proposes a statute or an amendment to a statute, the person
who intends to circulate it shall file a copy with the secretary of state before beginning circulation
and not earlier than January 1 of the year preceding the year in which a regular session of the
legislature is held.  After its circulation, it shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than
30 days prior to any regular session of the legislature.  The circulation of the petition shall cease
on the day the petition is filed with the secretary of state or such date as may be prescribed for the
verification of the number of signatures affixed to the petition, whichever is earliest.  The
secretary of state shall transmit such petition to the legislature as soon as the legislature convenes
and organizes.  The petition shall take precedence over all other measures except appropriation
bills, and the statute or amendment to a statute proposed thereby shall be enacted or rejected by
the legislature without change or amendment within 40 days.  If the proposed statue or
amendment to a statute is enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor in the same
manner as other statutes are enacted, such statute or amendment to a statute shall become law,
but shall be subject to referendum petition as provided in section 1 of this article.  If the statute or
amendment to a statue is rejected by the legislature, or if no action is taken thereon within 40
days, the secretary of state shall submit the question of approval or disapproval of such statute or
amendment to a statute to a vote of the voters at the next succeeding general election.  If a
majority of the voters voting on such questions at such election votes approval of such statute or
amendment to a statute, it shall become law and take effect upon completion of the canvass of
votes by the supreme court.  An initiative measure so approved by the voters shall not be
amended, annulled, repealed, set aside or suspended by the legislature within 3 years from the
date it takes effect.  If a majority of such voters votes disapproval of such statute or amendment
to a statute, no further action shall be taken on such petition.  If the legislature reject such
proposed statute or amendment, the governor may recommend to the legislature and the
legislature may propose a different measure on the same subject, in which event, after such
different measure has been approved by the governor, the question of approval or disapproval of
each measure shall be submitted by the secretary of state to a vote of the voters at the next
succeeding general election.  If the conflicting provisions submitted to the voters are both
approved by a majority of the voters voting on such measures, the measure which receives the
largest number of affirmative votes shall thereupon become law.
     4.  If the initiative petition proposes an amendment to the constitution, the person who
intends to circulate it shall file a copy with the secretary of state before beginning circulation and
not earlier than September 1 of the year before the year in which the election is to be held.  After
its circulation it shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than 90 days before any regular
general election at which the question of approval or disapproval of such amendment may be
voted upon by the voters of the entire state.  The circulation of the petition shall cease on the day
the petition is filed with the secretary of state or such other date as may be prescribed for the
verification of the number of signatures affixed to the petition, whichever is earliest.  The
secretary of state shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation, on three
separate occasions, in each county in the state, together with any explanatory matter which shall
be placed upon the ballot, the entire text of the proposed amendment. If a majority of the voters
voting on such question at such election votes disapproval of such amendment, no further action
shall be taken on the petition.  If a majority of such voters votes approval of such amendment, the
secretary of state shall publish and resubmit the question of approval or disapproval to a vote of
the voters at the next succeeding general election in the same manner as such question was
originally submitted.  If a majority of such voters votes disapproval of such amendment, no
further action shall be taken on such petition.  If a majority of such voters votes approval of such
amendment, it shall become a part of this constitution upon completion of the canvass of votes
by the supreme court.

SECTION 3.  State indebtedness: Limitations and exceptions.  The state may contract public
debts; but such debts shall never, in the aggregate, exclusive of interest, exceed the sum of two
per cent of the assessed valuation of the state, as shown by the reports of the county assessors to
the state controller, except for the purpose of defraying extraordinary expenses, as hereinafter
mentioned.  Every such debt shall be authorized by law for some purpose or purposes, to be
distinctly specified therein; and every such law shall provide for levying an annual tax sufficient
to pay the interest semiannually, and the principal within twenty years from the passage of such
law, and shall specially appropriate the proceeds of said taxes to the payment of said principal
and interest; and such appropriation shall not be repealed nor the taxes postponed or diminished
until the principal and interest of said debts shall have been wholly paid.  Every contract of
indebtedness entered into or assumed by or on behalf of the state, when all its debts and liabilities
amount to said sum before mentioned, shall be void and of no effect, except in cases of money
borrowed to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, defend the state in time of war, or, if hostilities
be threatened, provide for the public defense.
     The state, notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, may, pursuant to authority of the
legislature, make and enter into any and all contracts necessary, expedient or advisable for the
protection and preservation of any of its property or natural resources, or for the purposes of
obtaining the benefits thereof, however arising and whether arising by or through any
undertaking or project of the United States or by or through any treaty or compact between the
states, or otherwise.  The legislature may from time to time make such appropriations as may be
necessary to carry out the obligations of the state under such contracts, and shall levy such tax as
may be necessary to pay the same or carry them into effect.

     1.  The legislature shall provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and

greater value for another use than that for which it is being used, as a separate class for taxation
purposes and may provide a separate uniform plan for appraisal and valuation of such property
for assessment purposes.  If such plan is provided, the legislature shall also provide for
retroactive assessment for a period of not less than 7 years when agricultural and open-space real
property is converted to a higher use conforming to the use for which other nearby property is
used.

of the State of Nevada, or which was consigned to a warehouse, public or private, within the
State of Nevada from outside the State of Nevada for storage in transit to a final destination
outside the State of Nevada, whether specified when transportation begins or afterward, shall be
deemed to have acquired no situs in Nevada for purposes of taxation and shall be exempt from
taxation.  Such property shall not be deprived of such exemption because while in the warehouse
the property is assembled, bound, joined, processed, disassembled, divided, cut, broken in bulk,
relabeled or repackaged.
     5.  The legislature may exempt motor vehicles from the provisions of the tax required by
this section, and in lieu thereof, if such exemption is granted, shall provide for a uniform and
equal rate of assessment and taxation of motor vehicles, which rate shall not exceed five cents on
one dollar of assessed valuation.

of the net proceeds.  No other tax may be imposed upon a mineral or its proceeds until the
identity of the proceeds as such is lost.
     2.  The legislature shall appropriate to each county that sum which would be produced by
levying a tax upon the entire amount of the net proceeds taxed in each taxing district in the
county at the rate levied in that district upon the assessed valuation of real property.  The total
amount so appropriated to each county must be apportioned among the respective governmental
units and districts within it, including the county itself and the school district, in the same
proportion as they state in the total taxes collected on property according to value.
     3.  Each patented mine or mining claim must be assessed and taxed as other real property
is assessed and taxed, except that no value may be attributed to any mineral known or believed to
underlie it, and no value may be attributed to the surface of a mine or claim if one hundred
dollars' worth of labor has been actually performed on the mine or claim during the year
preceding the assessment.

provide by law, or if it fails to do so the court shall provide by rule, for the appointment of
attorneys at law to the positions designated in this section to be occupied by members of the State
Bar of Nevada.
     4.  The term of office of each appointive member of the commission, except the first
members, is 4 years.  Each appointing authority shall appoint one of the members first appointed
for a term of 2 years.  If a vacancy occurs, the appointing authority shall fill the vacancy for the

     (b) Retired except for advanced age which interferes with the proper performance of his
judicial duties, or for mental or physical disability which prevents the proper performance of his
judicial duties and which is likely to be permanent in nature.
     7.  Any person may bring to the attention of the commission any matter relating to the
fitness of a justice of judge.  The commission shall, after preliminary investigation, dismiss the
matter or order a hearing to be held before it.  If a hearing is ordered, a statement of the matter
shall be served upon the justice or judge against whom the proceeding is brought.  The
commission in its discretion may suspend a justice or judge from the exercise of his office
pending the determination of the proceedings before the commission.  Any justice or judge
whose removal is sought is liable to indictment and punishment according to the law.  A justice
or judge retired for disability in accordance with this section is entitled thereafter to receive such
compensation as the legislature may provide.
     8.  If a proceeding is brought against a justice of the supreme court, no justice may sit on
the commission for that proceeding.  If a proceeding is brought against a district judge, no judge
from the same judicial district may sit on the commission for that proceeding.  If a proceeding is
brought against a justice of the peace, no justice of the peace from the same township may sit on
the commission for that proceeding.  If a proceeding is brought against a municipal judge, no
municipal judge from the same city may sit on the commission for that proceeding.  If an appeal
is taken from an action of the commission to the supreme court, any justice who sat on the
commission for that proceeding is disqualified from participating in the consideration or decision
of the appeal.  When any member of the commission is disqualified by this subsection, the
supreme court shall appoint a substitute from among the eligible judges.
     9.  The commission may:
     (a) Designate for each hearing an attorney or attorneys at law to act as counsel to conduct

necessary and proper in order to compel the giving of testimony under oath and the production of
books, papers, documents and records; and
     (d) Exercise such further powers as the legislature may from time to time confer upon it.

SECTION 9.  Recall of public officers: Procedure and limitations.  Every public officer in the
State of Nevada is subject, as herein provided, to recall from office by the registered voters of the
state, or of the county, district, or municipality, which he represents.  For this purpose a number
of registered voters not less than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the number who actually voted in
the state or in the county, district, or municipality which he represents, at the election in which he
was elected, shall file their petition, in the manner herein provided, demanding his recall by the
people.  They shall set forth in said petition, in not exceeding two hundred (200) words, the
reasons why said recall is demanded.  If he shall offer his resignation, it shall be accepted and
take effect on the day it is offered, and the vacancy thereby caused shall be filled in the manner
provided by law.  If he shall not resign within five (5) days after the petition is filed, a special
election shall be ordered to be held within thirty days (30) after the issuance of the call therefor,
in the state, or county, district, or municipality electing said officer, to determine whether the
people will recall said officer.  On the ballot at said election shall be printed verbatim as set forth
in the recall petition, the reasons for demanding the recall of said officer, and in not more than
two hundred (200) words, the officer's justification of his course in office.  He shall continue to
perform the duties of his office until the result of said election shall be finally declared.  Other
candidates for the office may be nominated to be voted for at said special election.  The candidate
who shall receive the highest number of votes at said special election shall be deemed elected for
the remainder of the term, whether it be the person against whom the recall petition was filed, or
another.  The recall petition shall be filed with the officer with whom the petition for nomination
to such office shall be filed, and the same officer shall order the special election when it is
required.  No such petition shall be circulated or filed against any officer until he has actually
held his office six (6) months, save and except that it may be filed against a senator or
assemblyman in the legislature at any time after ten (10) days from the beginning of the first
session after his election.  After one such petition and special election, no further recall petition
shall be filed against the same officer during the term for which he was elected, unless such
further petitioners shall pay into the public treasury from which the expenses of said special
election have been paid, the whole amount paid out of said public treasury as expenses for the
preceding special election.  Such additional legislation as may aid the operation of this section
shall be provided by law.

to the limitations of section 6 of this article, the people reserve to themselves the power to
propose, by initiative petition, statues and amendments to statutes and amendments to this
constitution, and to enact or reject them at the polls.  
     2.  An initiative petition shall be in the form required by section 3 of this article and shall
be proposed by a number of registered voters equal to 10 percent or more of the number of voters
who voted at the last preceding general election in not less than 75 percent of the counties in the
state, but the total number of registered voters signing the initiative petition shall be equal to 10
percent or more of the voters who voted in the entire state at the last preceding general election.
     3.  If the initiative petition proposes a statute or an amendment to a statute, the person
who intends to circulate it shall file a copy with the secretary of state before beginning circulation
and not earlier than January 1 of the year preceding the year in which a regular session of the
legislature is held.  After its circulation, it shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than
30 days prior to any regular session of the legislature.  The circulation of the petition shall cease
on the day the petition is filed with the secretary of state or such date as may be prescribed for the
verification of the number of signatures affixed to the petition, whichever is earliest.  The
secretary of state shall transmit such petition to the legislature as soon as the legislature convenes
and organizes.  The petition shall take precedence over all other measures except appropriation
bills, and the statute or amendment to a statute proposed thereby shall be enacted or rejected by
the legislature without change or amendment within 40 days.  If the proposed statue or
amendment to a statute is enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor in the same
manner as other statutes are enacted, such statute or amendment to a statute shall become law,
but shall be subject to referendum petition as provided in section 1 of this article.  If the statute or
amendment to a statue is rejected by the legislature, or if no action is taken thereon within 40
days, the secretary of state shall submit the question of approval or disapproval of such statute or
amendment to a statute to a vote of the voters at the next succeeding general election.  If a
majority of the voters voting on such questions at such election votes approval of such statute or
amendment to a statute, it shall become law and take effect upon completion of the canvass of
votes by the supreme court.  An initiative measure so approved by the voters shall not be
amended, annulled, repealed, set aside or suspended by the legislature within 3 years from the
date it takes effect.  If a majority of such voters votes disapproval of such statute or amendment
to a statute, no further action shall be taken on such petition.  If the legislature reject such
proposed statute or amendment, the governor may recommend to the legislature and the
legislature may propose a different measure on the same subject, in which event, after such
different measure has been approved by the governor, the question of approval or disapproval of
each measure shall be submitted by the secretary of state to a vote of the voters at the next
succeeding general election.  If the conflicting provisions submitted to the voters are both
approved by a majority of the voters voting on such measures, the measure which receives the
largest number of affirmative votes shall thereupon become law.  If at the session of the
legislature to which an initiative petition proposing an amendment to a statute is presented which
the legislature rejects or upon which it takes no action, the legislature amends the statute which
the petition proposes to amend in a respect which does not conflict in substance with the
proposed amendment, the secretary of state in submitting the statute to the voters for approval or
disapproval of the proposed amendment shall include the amendment made by the legislature.
     4.  If the initiative petition proposes an amendment to the constitution, the person who
intends to circulate it shall file a copy with the secretary of state before beginning circulation and
not earlier than September 1 of the year before the year in which the election is to be held.  After
its circulation it shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than 90 days before any regular
general election at which the question of approval or disapproval of such amendment may be
voted upon by the voters of the entire state.  The circulation of the petition shall cease on the day
the petition is filed with the secretary of state or such other date as may be prescribed for the
verification of the number of signatures affixed to the petition, whichever is earliest.  The
secretary of state shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation, on three
separate occasions, in each county in the state, together with any explanatory matter which shall
be placed upon the ballot, the entire text of the proposed amendment. If a majority of the voters
voting on such question at such election votes disapproval of such amendment, no further action
shall be taken on the petition.  If a majority of such voters votes approval of such amendment, the
secretary of state shall publish and resubmit the question of approval or disapproval to a vote of
the voters at the next succeeding general election in the same manner as such question was
originally submitted.  If a majority of such voters votes disapproval of such amendment, no
further action shall be taken on such petition.  If a majority of such voters votes approval of such
amendment, it shall, unless precluded by subsection 5 or 6, become a part of this constitution
upon completion of the canvass of votes by the supreme court.
     5.  If two or more measures which affect the same section of a statute or of the
constitution are finally approved pursuant to this section, or an amendment to the constitution is
finally so approved and an amendment proposed by the legislature is ratified which affect the
same section, by the voters at the same election:
     (a) If all can be given effect without contradiction in substance, each shall be given effect.
     (b) If one or more contradict in substance the other or others, the measure which received
the largest favorable vote, and any other approved measure compatible with it, shall be given
effect.  If the one or more measures that contradict in substance the other or others receive the
same number of favorable votes, none of the measures that contradict another shall be given
effect.  
     6.  If, at the same election as the first approval of a constitutional amendment pursuant to
this section, another amendment is finally approved pursuant to this section, or an amendment
proposed by the legislature is ratified, which affects the same section of the constitution but is
compatible with the amendment given first approval, the secretary of state shall publish and
resubmit at the next general election the amendment given first approval as a further amendment
to the section as amended by the amendment given final approval or ratified.  If the amendment
finally approved or ratified contradicts in substance the amendment given first approval, the
secretary of state shall not submit the amendment given the first approval to the voters again.
