SEC. 2. The General Assembly which shall be held on the Wednesday after the first Monday of January, 1903,
shall divide the State into senatorial districts, as hereinafter provided; the number of such districts shall not be
less than twenty-four nor more than thirty-six, and each district shall elect only one Senator. The districts shall
always be composed of contiguous territory, and in forming them regard shall be had to population in the several
districts, that the same may be as nearly equal as possible under the limitations of this amendment. Neither the
whole or a part of one county shall be joined to the whole or a part of another county to form a district, and no
town shall be divided, unless for the purpose of forming more than one district wholly within such town, and
each county shall have at least one Senator. The districts, when established as hereinafter provided, shall
continue the same until the session of the General Assembly next after the completion of the next census of the
United States, which General Assembly shall have power to alter the same, if found necessary to preserve a
proper equality of population in each district, but only in accordance with the principles above recited; after
which said districts shall not be altered, nor the number of Senators altered, except at a session of the General
Assembly next after the completion of a census of the United States, and then only in accordance with the
principles hereinbefore provided.

[Adopted October, 1901.]

Each bill which shall have passed both houses of the general assembly shall be presented to the governor. If he
shall approve, he shall sign and transmit it to the secretary of the state, but if he shall disapprove, he shall
transmit it to the secretary with his objections, and the secretary shall thereupon return the bill to the house in
which it originated, with the governor's objections, which shall be entered on the journal of the house, which
shall proceed to reconsider the bill. If, after such reconsideration, that house shall again pass it, it shall be sent
with the objections to the other house, which shall also reconsider it. If approved, it shall be a law and be
transmitted to the secretary; but in such case the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays and
the names of the members voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house
respectively. In case the governor shall not transmit the bill to the secretary, either with his approval pr with his
objections, within five calendar days, Sundays and legal holidays excepted, after the same shall have been
presented to him, it shall be a law at the expiration of that period unless the general assembly shall then have
adjourned sine die, in which case the bill should be a law unless the governor shall, within fifteen calendar days
after the same shall have been presented to him, transmit it to the secretary with his objections, in which case it
shall not be a law.
Bills may be presented to the governor after the adjournment sine die of the general assembly, and the general
assembly may by law consistent with this amendment regulate the time and method of performing all ministerial
acts necessary or incidental to the administration of this amendment. This amendment shall not impair the
powers granted to the governor by article VII of the amendments to the constitution.
