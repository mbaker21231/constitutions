2. Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed by constitutional provision shall

any court whatever the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel
as in civil actions and shall be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and be confronted
with the witnesses against him.  No person shall be subject to be twice put in jeopardy for the same

any public officer who, upon being called before a grand jury to testify concerning the conduct of his
office or the performance of his official duties, refuses to sign a waiver of immunity against subsequent
criminal prosecution, or to answer any relevant question concerning such matters before a grand jury,
shall be removed from office by the appropriate authority or shall forfeit his office at the suit of the

court without a jury, but not with a referee other than an official referee, or by not less than three
commissioners appointed by a court of record, as shall be prescribed by law.
    (c) Private roads may be opened in the manner to be prescribed by law; but in every case the
necessity of the road and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening thereof shall be first
determined by a jury of freeholders, and such amount, together with the expenses of the proceedings,
shall be paid by the person to be benefited.
    (d) The use of property for the drainage of swamp or agricultural lands is declared to be a public
use, and general laws may be passed permitting the owners or occupants of swamp or agricultural lands
to construct and maintain for the drainage thereof, necessary drains, ditches and dykes upon the lands
of others, under proper restrictions, on making just compensation, and such compensation together with
the cost of such drainage may be assessed, wholly or partly, against any property benefited thereby; but
no special laws shall be enacted for such purposes.
    (e) The legislature may authorize cities and counties to take more land and property than is
needed for actual construction in the laying out, widening, extending or relocating parks, public places,
highways or streets; provided, however, that the additional land and property so authorized to be taken
shall be no more than sufficient to form suitable building sites abutting on such park, public place,
highway or street. After so much of the land and property has been appropriated for such park, public
place, highway or street as is needed therefor, the remainder may be sold or leased.

readjustment or alteration of senate and assembly districts next occurring, in so far as such census and
the tabulation thereof purport to give the information necessary therefor. The legislature, by law, shall
provide for the making and tabulation by state authorities of an enumeration of the inhabitants of the
entire state to be used for such purposes, instead of a federal census, if the taking of a federal census in
any tenth year from the year nineteen hundred thirty be omitted or if the federal census fails to show the
number of aliens or Indians not taxed.  If a federal census, though giving the requisite information as to
the state at large, fails to give the information as to any civil or territorial divisions which is required to
be known for such purposes, the legislature, by law, shall provide for such an enumeration of the
inhabitants of such parts of the state only as may be necessary, which shall supersede in part the federal
census and be used in connection therewith for such purposes. The legislature, by law, may provide in
its discretion for an enumeration by state authorities of the inhabitants of the state, to be used for such
purposes, in place of a federal census, when the return of a decennial federal census is delayed so that it
is not available at the beginning of the regular session of the legislature in the second year after the year
nineteen hundred thirty or after any tenth year therefrom, or if an apportionment of members of
assembly and readjustment or alteration of senate districts is not made at or before such a session.  At
the regular session in the year nineteen hundred thirty-two and at the first regular session after the year
nineteen hundred forty and after each tenth year therefrom the senate districts shall be readjusted or
altered, but if, in any decade, counting from and including that which begins with the year nineteen
hundred thirty-one, such a readjustment or alteration is not made at the time above prescribed, it shall
be made at a subsequent session occurring not later than the sixth year of such decade, meaning not
later than nineteen hundred thirty-six, nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred fifty-six, and so on;
provided, however, that if such districts shall have been readjusted or altered by law in either of the
years nineteen hundred thirty or nineteen hundred thirty-one, they shall remain unaltered until the first
regular session after the year nineteen hundred forty.  Such districts shall be so readjusted or altered
that each senate district shall contain as nearly as may be an equal number of inhabitants, excluding
aliens, and be in as compact form as practicable, and shall remain unaltered until the first year of the
next decade as above defined, and shall at all times consist of contiguous territory, and no county shall
be divided in the formation of a senate district except to make two or more senate districts wholly in
such county.  No town, and no block in a city inclosed by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the
formation of senate districts; nor shall any district contain a greater excess in population over an
adjoining district in the same county, than the population of a town or block therein adjoining such
district.  Counties, towns or blocks which, from their location, may be included in either of two districts,
shall be so placed as to make said districts most nearly equal in number of inhabitants, excluding aliens.
No county shall have four or more senators unless it shall have a full ratio for each senator.  No county
shall have more than one-third of all the senators; and no two counties or the territory thereof as now
organized, which are adjoining counties, or which are separated only by public waters, shall have more
than one-half of all the senators.
 The ratio for apportioning senators shall always be obtained by dividing the number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens, by fifty, and the senate shall always be composed of fifty members, except
that if any county having three or more senators at the time of any apportionment shall be entitled on
such ratio to an additional senator or senators, such additional senator or senators shall be given to such
county in addition to the fifty senators, and the whole number of senators shall be increased to that
extent.   
The senate districts, including the present ones, as existing immediately before the enactment of a law
readjusting or altering the senate districts, shall continue to be the senate districts of the state until the
expirations of the terms of the senators then in office, except for the purpose of an election of senators
for full terms beginning at such expirations, and for the formation of assembly districts.

5.  The members of the assembly shall be chosen by single districts and shall be apportioned by the
legislature at each regular session at which the senate districts are readjusted or altered, and by the
same law, among the several counties of the state, as nearly as may be according to the number of their
respective inhabitants, excluding aliens.  Every county heretofore established and separately organized,
except the county of Hamilton, shall always be entitled to one member of assembly, and no county shall
hereafter be erected unless its population shall entitle it to a member.  The county of Hamilton shall elect
with the county of Fulton, until the population of the county of Hamilton shall, according to the ratio,
entitle it to a member.  But the legislature may abolish the said county of Hamilton and annex the
territory thereof to some other county or counties. 
   The quotient obtained by dividing the whole number of inhabitants of the state, excluding aliens, by
the number of members of assembly, shall be the ratio for apportionment, which shall be made as
follows: One member of assembly shall be apportioned to every county, including Fulton and Hamilton
as one county, containing less than the ratio and one-half over.  Two members shall be apportioned to
every other county.  The remaining members of assembly shall be apportioned to the counties having
more than two ratios according to the number of inhabitants, excluding aliens.  Members apportioned
on remainders shall be apportioned to the counties having the highest remainders in the order thereof
respectively.  No county shall have more members of assembly than a county having a greater number
of inhabitants, excluding aliens.  
The assembly districts, including the present ones, as existing immediately before the enactment of a law
making an apportionment of members of assembly among the counties, shall continue to be the
assembly districts of the state until the expiration of the terms of members then in office, except for the
purpose of an election of members of assembly for full terms beginning at such expirations.
In any county entitled to more than one member, the board of supervisors, and in any city embracing an
entire county and having no board of supervisors, the common council, or if there be none, the body
exercising the powers of a common council, shall assemble at such times as the legislature making an
apportionment shall prescribe, and divide such counties into assembly districts as nearly equal in
number of inhabitants, excluding aliens, as may be, of convenient and contiguous territory in as compact
form as practicable, each of which  shall be wholly within a senate district formed under the same
apportionment, equal to the number of members of assembly to which such  county shall be entitled,
and shall cause to be filed in the office of the secretary of state and of the clerk of such county, a
description of such districts, specifying the number of each district and of the inhabitants thereof,
excluding aliens, according to the census or enumeration used as the population basis for the formation
of such districts; and such apportionment and districts shall remain unaltered until after the next
reapportionment of members of assembly.  In counties having more than one senate district, the same
number of assembly districts shall be put in each senate district, unless the assembly districts cannot be
evenly divided among the senate districts of any county, in which case one more assembly district shall
be put in the senate district in such county having the largest, or one less assembly district shall be put in
the senate district in such county having the smallest number of inhabitants, excluding aliens, as the case
may require. No town, and no block in a city inclosed by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the
formation of assembly districts, nor shall any districts contain a greater excess in population over an
adjoining district in the same senate district, than the population of a town or block therein adjoining
such assembly district. Towns or blocks which, from their location may be included in either of two
districts, shall be so placed as to make said districts most nearly equal in number of inhabitants,
excluding aliens. Nothing in this section shall prevent the division, at any time, of counties and towns and
the erection of new towns by the legislature.
An apportionment by the legislature, or other body, shall be subject to review by the supreme court, at
the suit of any citizen, under such reasonable regulations as the legislature may prescribe; and any court
before which a cause may be pending involving an apportionment, shall give precedence thereto over all
other causes and proceedings, and if said court be not in session it shall convene promptly for the
disposition of the same.

1. The supreme court is continued with general jurisdiction in law and equity, subject to such appellate
jurisdiction of the court of appeals as now is or hereafter may be prescribed by law not inconsistent
with this article.  The existing judicial districts of the state are continued until changed as hereinafter
provided.  The supreme court shall consist of the justices now in office and their successors, together
with such additional justices as may be authorized by law.  The a successors of said justices shall be
chosen by the electors of their respective judicial districts.  The legislature may alter the judicial districts
once after every federal census or state enumeration, each district being bounded by county lines and
thereupon re-apportion the justices to be thereafter elected in the districts so altered.  The legislature
may from time to time increase the number of justices in any judicial district, except the number of
justices in any district shall not be increased to exceed one justice for each sixty thousand, or fraction
over thirty-five thousand, of the population thereof as shown by the last federal census or state
enumeration.  Any justice of the supreme court, except as otherwise provided in this article, may
perform the duties of his office or hold court in any county.

 2. The division of the state into four judicial departments is continued as now constituted by law.  Once
every ten years, the legislature may alter the boundaries of the judicial departments, but without
increasing the number thereof, and each department shall be bounded by the lines of judicial districts.
The appellate divisions of the supreme court are continued, and shall consist of seven justices of the
supreme court in each of the first and second departments, and five justices in each of the other
departments.  In each appellate division, four justices shall constitute a quorum, and the concurrence of
three shall be necessary to a decision.  No more than five justices shall sit in any case.
The governor shall designate the presiding justice of each appellate division, who shall act as such
during his term of office and shall be a resident of the department.  The other justices of the appellate
divisions shall be designated by the governor, from all the justices elected to the supreme court, for
terms of five years or the unexpired portions of their respective terms of office, if less than five years..
The justices heretofore designated shall continue to sit in the appellate divisions until the terms of  their 
respective  designations shall expire.  From time to time as the terms of the designations expire, or
vacancies occur, the governor shall  make new designations.  He may also, on request of any appellate 
division, make temporary designations in case of the absence or inability to act of any justice in such
appellate division, for service only during such absence or inability to act.  In case any appellate division
shall certify to the governor that one or more additional justices are needed for the speedy disposition
of the business before it, the governor shall designate an additional justice or additional justices; but
when the need for such additional justice or justices shall no longer exist, the appellate division shall so
certify to the governor, and thereupon service under such designation or designations shall cease.  A
majority of the justices designated to sit in any appellate division shall at all times be residents of the
department.
Whenever the appellate division in any department shall be unable to dispose of its business within a
reasonable time, a majority of the presiding justices of the several departments, at a meeting called by
the presiding justice of the department in arrears, may transfer any pending appeals from such
department to any other department for hearing and determination.
The several appellate divisions, except as hereinafter provided, shall have and exercise such original or
appellate jurisdiction as is now or may hereafter be prescribed by law.  Each appellate division shall
have power to appoint and remove its clerk and attendants.  No justice of the appellate division shall,
within the department to which he may be designated to perform the duties of an appellate justice,
exercise any of the powers of a justice of the supreme court, other than those of a justice out of court,
and those pertaining to the appellate division, except that he may decide causes or proceedings
theretofore submitted, or hear and decide motions submitted by consent of counsel, but any such
justice, when not actually engaged in performing the duties of such appellate justice in the department to
which he is designated, may hold any term of the supreme court and exercise any of the powers of a
justice of the supreme court in any judicial district in any other department of the state. From and after
the last day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, the appellate division shall have the
jurisdiction now exercised by the supreme court at its general terms and by the general terms of the
court of common pleas for the city and county of New York, the superior court of the city of New
York, the superior court of Buffalo and the city of Brooklyn, and such additional jurisdiction as may be
conferred by the legislature.  The justices of the appellate division in each department shall have power
to fix the times and places for holding special and trial terms of the supreme court held therein and to
assign the justices in the departments to hold such terms; or to make rules therefor.

3.  The appellate divisions in the first and second departments shall severally have power to establish an
appellate term of the supreme court to be held in and for its department, to be constituted of not less
than three nor more than five justices of the supreme court, who shall be designated from time to time
by such appellate division and shall be residents of the department.  Any such appellate term may be
discontinued and reestablished as said appellate divisions, respectively, from time to time shall
determine, and any designation to service therein may be revoked at any time by the appellate division
so designating.  In each appellate term, no more than three justices assigned thereto shall sit in any case;
two of such justices shall constitute a quorum, and the concurrence of two shall be necessary to a
decision.  Such appellate terms shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all appeals now or
hereafter authorized by law to be taken to the supreme court or to the appellate division other than
appeals from the supreme court, a surrogate's court, or the court of general sessions of the city of New
York, as may f rom time to time be directed by the appellate division establishing such appellate term.
The appellate term or the appellate division establishing it may allow an appeal from such appellate term
to such appellate division whenever in the opinion of either a question of law or fact is involved which
ought to be reviewed.

general election held not less than three months after such vacancy occurs; and until the vacancy shall
be so filled, the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, if the senate shall be in

 5. The court of appeals is continued. It shall consist of the chief judge, the six elected associate judges
now in office, who shall hold their offices until the expiration of their respective terms, and their
successors, who shall be chosen by the electors of the state, and such justices of the supreme court as
may be designated for service in said court as hereinafter provided. The official terms of the chief judge
and elected associate judges shall be fourteen years from and including the first day of January next
after their election. Five members of the court shall constitute a quorum and the concurrence of four
shall be necessary to a decision; but no more than seven judges shall sit in any case. In case of the
temporary absence or inability to act of any judge of the court of appeals, the court may  designate any
justice of the supreme court to serve as associate judge of the court during such absence or inability to
act. The court shall have power to appoint and to remove its clerk and attendants. 
   Whenever and as often as the court of appeals shall certify to the governor that the court is unable, by
reason of the accumulation of causes pending therein, to hear and dispose of the same with reasonable
speed, the governor shall designate such number of justices of the supreme court as may be so certified
to be necessary, but not more than four, to serve as associate judges of the court of appeals.  The
justices so designated shall be relieved, while so serving, from their duties as justices of the supreme
court, and shall serve as associate judges of the court of appeals until the court shall certify that the
need for the services of any such justices no longer exists, whereupon they shall return to the supreme
court. The governor may fill vacancies among such designated judges. No such justice shall serve as
associate judge of the court of appeals except while holding the office of justice of the supreme court.
The designation of a justice of the supreme court as an associate judge of the court appeals shall not be
deemed to affect his existing office any longer than until the expiration of his designation as such
associate judge, nor to create a vacancy.

election held not less than three months after such vacancy occurs; and until the vacancy shall be so
filled, the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate if the senate shall be in session, or
if not in session, the governor may fill such vacancy by appointment.  If any such appointment be made
from among the justices of the supreme court, such appointment shall not be deemed to affect his
existing office any longer than until the expiration of his appointment as such associate judge, nor to
create a vacancy. If any such appointment of chief judge shall be made from among the associate
judges, a temporary appointment of associate judge shall be made in like manner; but, in such case, the
appointment shall not be deemed to affect his office of associate judge any longer than until the
expiration of his appointment as chief judge, nor to create a vacancy. The powers and jurisdiction of the
court shall not be suspended for want of appointment or election when the number of judges is sufficient
to constitute a quorum. All appointments under this section shall continue until and including the last day
of December next after the election at which the vacancy shall be filled.

7. The jurisdiction of the court of appeals, except where the judgment is of death, or where the
appellate division, on reversing or modifying a final judgment in an action or a final order in a special
proceeding, makes new findings of fact and renders final judgment or a final order thereon, shall be
limited to the review of questions of law; but the right to appeal shall not depend upon the amount
involved.
Appeals may be taken to the court of appeals in the classes of cases enumerated in this section.
In criminal cases, directly from a court of original jurisdiction where the judgment is of death, and in
other criminal cases from an appellate division or otherwise as the legislature may from time to time
provide.
In civil cases and proceedings as follows:
(1) As of right, from a judgment or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division of the
supreme court which finally determines an action or special proceeding wherein is directly involved the
construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States, or where one or more of the justices
of the appellate division dissents from the decision of the court, or where the judgment or order is one
of reversal or modification.
(2) As of right, from an order of the appellate division granting a new trial where the appellant stipulates
that, upon affirmance, judgment absolute shall be rendered against him.
(3) As of right, from a judgment or order of a court of record of original jurisdiction which finally
determines an action or special proceeding where the only question involved on the appeal is the
validity of a statutory provision of the state or of the United States under the constitution of the state or
of the United States; and on any such appeal only the constitutional question shall be considered and
determined by the court.
(4) From a determination of the appellate division of the supreme court in any department, other than a
judgment or order which finally determines an action or special proceeding, where the appellate division
allows the same and certifies that one or more questions of law have arisen which, in its opinion, ought
to be reviewed by the court of appeals, but in such case the appeal shall bring up for review only the
question or questions so certified; and the court of appeals shall certify to the appellate division its
determination upon such question or questions.
5) From a judgement or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division of the supreme court
which finally determines an action or special proceeding but which is not appealable under subdivision
one of this section where the appellate division shall certify that in its opinion a question of law is
involved which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals, or where, in case of the refusal so to
certify, an appeal is allowed by the court of appeals.  Such an appeal shall be allowed when required in
the interest of substantial justice.  The legislature may further restrict the jurisdiction of the court of
appeals and the right of appeal thereto.  No appeal shall be taken to said court of appeals from a final
judgement or order of the appellate division in any civil case or proceeding originally commenced in any
court other than the supreme court, a county court, a surrogate's court, or a court of claims or board of
audit unless the appellate division of the supreme court shall certify that in its opinion a question of law is
involved which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals.

of them.  On the trial of an impeachment against the governor or lieutenant-governor, neither the
lieutenant-governor nor the temporary president of the senate shall act as a member of the court.  No
judicial officer shall exercise his office after articles of impeachment against him shall have been
preferred to the senate, until he shall have been acquitted.  Before the trial of an impeachment, the
members of the court shall take an oath or affirmation truly and impartially to try the impeachment
according to the evidence, and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of
the members present.  Judgement in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from

The additional county judges whose offices may be created by the legislature shall be chosen at the
general election held in the first odd-numbered year after the creation of such office. All county judges,
including successors to existing judges, shall be chosen by the electors of the counties for the term of six
years from and including the first day of January following their election except that in counties within
the city of New York the term shall be fourteen years. County courts in counties outside the city of
New York shall have the powers and jurisdiction now prescribed by law, and also original jurisdiction
in actions for the recovery of money only, where all the defendants reside in the county and in which the
complaint demands judgment for a sum not exceeding three thousand dollars; but, if, in any action
brought in said court, a counterclaim for more than three thousand dollars shall be interposed, the
supreme court, on the application of either party made in the judicial district embracing the county, may
remove the cause to the supreme court, whereupon such action shall proceed and be heard as if
originally brought therein. The legislature may hereafter enlarge or restrict the jurisdiction of the county
courts provided, however, that their jurisdiction shall not be so extended as to authorize an action
therein for the recovery of money only in which (1) the sum demanded exceeds three thousand dollars,
or (2) in which any person not a resident of the county is a defendant, unless such defendant have an
office for the transaction of business within the county and the cause of action arose therein.  From and
after the first day of January in the second year following the adoption of this article, all the jurisdiction
in civil actions or proceedings now vested in county courts of the counties of Kings, Bronx, Queens and
Richmond shall be withdrawn from such county courts and vested in the city court of the city of New
York as constituted in and by section fifteen of this article, and said county courts shall thereafter be
vested with jurisdiction only in criminal prosecutions or proceedings as now or hereafter provided by
law.  County judges shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law, and their compensation, as
established by law, shall be payable out of the county treasury.  A county judge of any county outside
the city of New York may hold the county court in any other county when requested by the county
judge of such other county; and, in case of the death, absence, or incapacity of a county judge, in a
county having no special county judge then able to serve, the governor may designate a county judge of
another county to hold the county court during such vacancy, absence, or inability to act.

may, in any county having a county court, provide for the election of a special county judge or special
surrogate, not to exceed two in any county, to discharge the duties of county judge or of surrogate in 
such cases as may be provided by law.  Any such special county judge or surrogate shall be chosen at

office on the first day of January following such election, but no appointment shall be made by the
governor to such office meantime.

population of more than one million.  Surrogates and surrogates' courts shall have the jurisdiction, legal
and equitable, and powers now established by law until otherwise provided by the legislature. The
county judge shall be and serve as surrogate of his county except where a separate surrogate has been

separate surrogate, the legislature may provide for the election of a separate officer to be surrogate,
whose term of office shall be six years. When the surrogate shall be elected as a separate officer, his
compensation shall be established by law, and shall be payable out of the county treasury.
The legislature may at any time provide that the duties of county judge and surrogate in any county be
discharged by the same person. For the relief of surrogates' courts, the legislature may confer upon the

previously vested in the respective county courts from which such cases are so transferred, but not
otherwise. Until the legislature shall otherwise provide, the clerk of the city court of the city of New
York and the chief clerk of the county court in each of the counties of Kings, Bronx, Queens and
Richmond, shall severally act within his county as a deputy clerk of the city court of the city of New

to recover from the railroad company or companies, by way of reimbursement (1) the entire amount of
the railroad improvements not an essential part of elimination, and (2) the amount of the net benefit to

such net benefit to be adjudicated after the completion of the work in the manner to be prescribed by
law, and in no event to exceed fifteen per centum of the expense of the elimination, exclusive of all
incidental improvements. The reimbursement by the railroad companies shall be payable at such times,

annually contributed to each such fund, would, with the fund and with the accumulations thereon and

succeeding the fiscal year in which such indebtedness was contracted, all such indebtedness and each
portion thereof from  time to time contracted, including any refunding thereof, shall be paid in annual
installments, the first of which, except in the case of refunding of indebtedness heretofore contracted,

     (b) The legislature shall provide by law for the organization and government of counties. No law
which shall be special or local in its terms or in its effect, or which shall relate specially to one county

elective governing body of each county to be affected, or, in any county having an alternative form of
government providing for an elective county executive officer, upon the request of the board of
supervisors or other elective governing body with the concurrence of such executive officer of each
county to be affected; or (b) upon a certificate of necessity by the governor to the legislature reciting the

2 (a) The legislature shall provide by law alternative forms of government for counties except counties
wholly included in a city and for the submission of one or more such forms of government to the
electors residing in such counties. No such form of government shall become operative in any such
county unless and until adopted at a general election held in such county by receiving a majority of the
total votes cast thereon in the county, and if any such form of government provides for the transfer of
any function of local government to or from the cities, the towns or the villages of the county, or any
class thereof, it shall not take effect with respect to such transfer unless the transfer or the form of
government containing it, shall also receive a majority of all the votes cast thereon in such cities, towns,
villages, or class thereof, as the case may be.
     (b) Any such form of government shall set forth the structure of the county government and the
manner in which it is to function. Any such form of government may provide for the appointment of any
county officers or their selection by any method of nomination and election, or the abolition of their
offices, and may also provide for the exercise by the board of supervisors or other elective governing
body of powers of local legislation and administration and the transfer of any or all of the functions and
duties of the county and the cities, towns, villages, districts and other units of government contained in
such county to each other or to the state, and for the abolition of offices, departments, agencies or units
of government when all of their functions are so transferred without regard to the provisions of this
article or any other provisions of this constitution inconsistent herewith.
     (c) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of section 1 hereof nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to impair or restrict the existing power of the legislature to enact laws relating to the
government of a county or the cities, towns, villages, districts or other units of government therein
contained until the adoption of a form of government by such county pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
section.
     (d) After the adoption of a form of government by a county pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
section, no law enacted pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 1 hereof which abolishes or creates an
elective office or changes the voting or veto power of or the method of removing an elective officer,
changes the term of office or reduces the salary of an elective officer during his term of office, abolishes,
transfers or curtails any power of an elective officer, or changes the form or composition of the elective
body of such county, shall become effective until at least sixty days after its final enactment. If within
such sixty days electors of the county in  number equal to at least five per centum of the total number of
votes cast in the county for governor at the last gubernatorial election shall file a petition with the county
clerk or corresponding officer of the county protesting against such law, it shall become effective only if
approved by the electors of such county at the next ensuing general election held at least sixty days
thereafter, in the manner provided in subdivision (a) of this section for the adoption of a form of
government.
     (e) If under a form of government adopted by a county pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section the
board of supervisors be abolished, the powers and duties of the board of supervisors, as prescribed by
t1he constitution or by statute, if not provided for by such form of government shall devolve upon the
elective governing body in such county.
     (f) In a city which includes an entire county, or two or more entire counties, the powers and duties

valuation of the real estate of such city, town or village subject to taxation, as determined by the last
completed assessment roll and the four preceding assessment rolls of such city, town or village, for city,
town or village taxes prior to the contracting of such indebtedness. In ascertaining the power of a city to
contract indebtedness pursuant to this article there may be excluded any such indebtedness if the
project or projects aided by guarantees representing such indebtedness or by loans for which such
indebtedness was contracted shall have yielded during the preceding year net revenue to be determined
annually by deducting from the gross revenues, including periodic subsidies therefor, received from such
project or projects, all costs of operation, maintenance repairs and replacements, and the interest on
such indebtedness and the amounts required in such year for the payment of such indebtedness;
provided that in the case of guarantees such interest and such amounts shall have been paid, and in the
case of loans an amount equal to such interest and such amounts shall have been paid to such city. The
legislature shall prescribe the method by which the amount of any such indebtedness to be excluded
shall be determined, and no such indebtedness shall be excluded except in accordance with such
determination. The legislature may confer appropriate jurisdiction on the appellate division of the
supreme court in the judicial departments in which such, cities are located for the purpose of
determining the amount of any such indebtedness to be so excluded.
The liability of a city, town or village on account of any contract for capital or periodic subsidies to be
paid subsequent to the then current year shall, for the purpose of ascertaining the power of such city,
town or village to contract indebtedness, be deemed indebtedness in the amount of the commuted value
of the total of such capital or periodic subsidies remaining unpaid calculated on the basis of an annual
interest rate of four per centum. Such periodic subsidies shall not be contracted for a period longer than
the life of the projects assisted thereby, and in no event for more than sixty years. Indebtedness
contracted pursuant to this article shall be excluded in ascertaining the power of a city otherwise to
create indebtedness under any other section of this constitution. Notwithstanding the foregoing the
legislature shall not authorize any city to contract indebtedness hereunder in excess of the limitations
prescribed by any other article of this constitution unless at the same time it shall by law require such
city to levy annually a tax or taxes other than an ad valorem tax on real estate to an extent sufficient to
provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on any such indebtedness.  Nothing herein
contained, however, shall be construed to prevent such city from pledging its faith and credit for the
payment of such principal and interest nor shall any such law prevent recourse to an ad valorem tax on
real estate to the extent that revenue derived from such other tax or taxes in any year, together with
revenues from the project or projects aided by the proceeds of such indebtedness, shall become
insufficient to provide fully for payment of such principal and interest in that year.
