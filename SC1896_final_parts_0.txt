after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass it, it shall be sent, together

thirds of that house it shall have the same effect as if it had been signed by the Governor; but in

his objections to the items or sections of the same not approved by him to the house in which the
bill originated, which house shall enter the objections at large upon its Journal and proceed to
reconsider so much of the bill as is not approved by the Governor.  The same proceedings shall
be had in both houses in reconsidering the same as is provided in case of an entire bill returned
by the Governor with his objections; and if any item or section of the bill not approved by the
Governor shall be passed by two-thirds of each house of the General Assembly, it shall become a
part of the law notwithstanding the objections of the Governor.

If a bill or joint resolution shall not be returned by the Governor within five days after it shall
have been presented to him, Sundays excepted, it shall have the same force and effect as if he had
signed it, unless the General Assembly, by adjournment, prevents return, in which case it shall
have such force and effect unless returned within two days after the next meeting.
