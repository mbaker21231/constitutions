SECTION 1. All political power is inherent in. the people. Government is institute for the
protection, security and benefit of the people, and they have the right to alter or reform the same

been or may be defined by the Supreme Court of the United States, and no power exists in the
people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith, or
perform any act tending to impair, subvert or resist the supreme authority of the United States. 
The Constitution of the United States confers full powers on the Federal Government to maintain
and perpetuate its existence; and whensoever any portion of the States, or the people thereof,
attempt to secede from the Federal Union, or forcibly resist the execution of its laws, the Federal
Government may, by warrant of the Constitution, employ armed force in compelling obedience
to its authority.
