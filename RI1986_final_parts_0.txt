Father of his Country, we declare that "the basis of our political systems is the right of the people
to make and alter their constitutions of government; but that the constitution which at any time
exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory
upon all."

No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any
person be denied equal protection of the laws. No otherwise qualified person shall, solely by

Section 3. Freedom of religion. Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; and all
attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend to
beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness; and whereas a principal object of our venerable
ancestors, in their migration to this country and their settlement of this state, was, as they
expressed it, to hold forth a lively experiment that a flourishing civil state may stand and be best
maintained with full liberty in religious concernments; we, therefore, declare that no person shall
be compelled to frequent or to support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatever, except
in fulfillment of such person's voluntary contract; nor enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened
in body or goods; nor disqualified from holding any office; nor otherwise suffer on account of
such person's religious belief; and that every person shall be free to worship God according to the
dictates of such person's conscience, and to profess and by argument to maintain such person's
opinion in matters of religion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect the
civil capacity of any person.

four (4) years thereafter, and shall severally hold their offices, subject to recall as provided for
herein, for four (4) years from the first Tuesday of January next succeeding their election and
until their successors are elected and qualified. No person shall serve consecutively in the same

years previously served. 
The senators and representatives in the general assembly shall be elected on the Tuesday after the
first Monday in November, biennially in even numbered years, and shall severally hold their
offices for two (2) years from the first Tuesday of January next succeeding their election and
until their successors are elected and qualified. 
Recall is authorized in the case of a general officer who has been indicted or informed against for
a felony, convicted of a misdemeanor, or against whom a finding of probable cause of violation
of the code of ethics has been made by the ethics commission. Recall shall not, however be
instituted at any time during the first six (6) months or the last year of an individual's term of
office. 
Such a recall may be instituted by filing with the state board of elections an application for
issuance of a recall petition against said general officer which is signed by duly qualified electors
equal to three percent (3%) of the total number of votes cast at the last preceding general election
for that office. If, upon verification, the application is determined to contain signatures of the
required number of electors, the state board of elections shall issue a recall petition for
circulation amongst t he electors of the state. Within ninety (90) days of issuance, recall petitions
containing the signatures of duly qualified electors constituting fifteen percent (15%) of the total
number of votes cast in the last preceding general election for said office must be filed with the
state board of elections. 
The signatures to the application and to the recall petition need not all be on one (1) sheet of
paper, but each such application and petition must contain an identical statement naming the
person to be recalled, the general office held by said person, and the grounds for such recall set
forth in a statement of one hundred (100) words or less approved by the board of elections. Each
signatory must set forth his or her signature as it appears on the voting list, the date of signing,
and his or her place of residence. The person witnessing the signatures of each elector on said
petition must sign a statement under oath on said sheet attesting that the signatures thereon are
genuine and were signed in his or her presence. 
If the requisite number of signatures are not obtained within said ninety (90) days period, the
recall effort shall terminate. Upon verification of the requisite number of signatures, a special
election shall be scheduled at which the issue of removing said office holder and the grounds
therefor shall be placed before the electors of the state. If a majority of those voting support
removal of said office holder, the office shall be immediately declared vacant and shall be filled
in accordance with the constitution and laws of the state. The person so removed shall not be
eligible to fill the unexpired portion of the term of office. The general assembly shall provide by
statute for implementation of the recall process.

Amendment V
Section 16. Limitation on state spending. (a) No appropriation, supplemental appropriation or

fiscal year to exceed ninety-eight percent (98%) of the estimated state general revenues for such
fiscal year from all sources, including estimated unencumbered general revenues to the new
fiscal year remaining at the end of the previous fiscal year. Estimated unencumbered general
revenues are calculated by taking the estimated general revenue cash balance at the end of the
fiscal year less estimated revenue anticipation bonds or notes, estimated general revenue
encumbrances, estimated continuing general revenue appropriations and the amount of the
budget reserve account at the end of said fiscal year. 
(b) The amount between the applicable percentage in (a) and one hundred percent (100%) of the
estimated state general revenue for any fiscal year as estimated in accordance with subsection (a)
of this section shall be appropriated in any given fiscal year into the budget reserve account;
provided, however, that no such payment will be made which would increase the total of the
budget reserve account to more than three percent (3%) of only the estimated state general
revenues as set by subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the payment to be made into the
budget reserve account would increase the amount in said account to more than three percent
(3%) of estimated state general revenues that said amount shall be transferred to the state bond
capitol fund to be used solely for the purposes of reduction of state indebtedness, payment of
debt service, and/or funding of capitol projects. 
(c) Within forty-five (45) days after the close of any fiscal year, all unencumbered general
revenue in the year end surplus account from the said fiscal year shall be transferred to the
