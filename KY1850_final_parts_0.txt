apportioned, as near as may be, among the counties, towns, and cities in each district; and in
making such apportionment the following rules shall govern, to wit: Every county, town, or city,
having the ratio, shall have one representative; if double the ratio, two representatives, and so on.

qualified voters above the ratio, and counties having the largest number under the ratio, shall have
