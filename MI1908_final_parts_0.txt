electors of this state but no proposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors unless the
number of petitioners therefor shall exceed twenty per cent of the total number of electors voting
for secretary of state at the preceding election of such officer.  All petitions shall contain the full
text of any proposed amendment, together with any existing provisions of the constitution which
would be altered or abrogated thereby.  Such petitions shall be signed at the regular registration
or election places at a regular registration or election under the supervision of the officials
thereof, who shall verify the genuineness of the signatures and certify the fact that the signers are
registered electors of the respective townships and cities in which they reside, and shall forthwith
forward the petitions to the secretary of state.  All petitions for amendments filed with the
secretary of state shall be certified by that officer to the legislature at the opening of its next
regular session; and when such petitions for any one proposed amendment shall be signed by not
less than the required number of petitioners, he shall also submit the proposed amendment to the
electors at the first regular election thereafter, unless the legislature in joint convention shall
disapprove of the proposed amendment by a majority vote of the members elected.  The
legislature may, by a like vote, submit an alternative or a substitute proposal on the same subject. 
The action of the legislature shall be entered on the journal of each house, with the yeas and nays
thereon.  But no amendment to this section may be proposed in the manner herein prescribed.   
     If a majority of the electors qualified to vote for members of the legislature voting thereon
shall ratify and approve any such amendment or amendments, the same shall become a part of the
constitution.  Provided, That for any amendment proposed under this section, the affirmative vote
shall be not less than one-third of the highest number of votes cast at the said election for any
office.  In case alternative proposed amendments on the same subject are submitted at the same
election, the vote shall be for one of such alternatives or against such proposed amendments as a
whole.  If the affirmative vote for one proposed amendment is the required majority of all the
votes cast for and against such proposed amendments, it shall become a part of the constitution. 
If the total affirmative vote for such alternative proposed amendments is the required majority of
all the votes for and against them, but no one proposed amendment receives such majority, then
the proposed amendment which receives the largest number of affirmative votes shall be
submitted at the next regular election, and if it then receives the required majority of all the votes
cast thereon it shall become a part of the constitution.  The legislature shall enact appropriate
laws to carry out the provisions of this section.

Section 4.  At the general election to be held in the year nineteen hundred twenty-six, in each
sixteenth year thereafter and at such other times as may be provided by law, the question of a
general revision of the constitution shall be submitted to the electors qualified to vote for
members of the legislature.  In case a majority of such electors voting at such election shall
decide in favor of a convention for such purpose, at the next biennial spring election the electors
of each senatorial district of the state as then organized shall elect three delegates.  The delegates
so elected shall convene at the state capitol on the first Tuesday in September next succeeding
such election, and shall continue their sessions until the business of the convention shall be
completed.  A majority of the delegates elected shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.  The convention shall choose its own officers, determine the rules of its proceedings
and judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its members.  In case of a vacancy by
death, resignation or otherwise, of any delegate, such vacancy shall be filled by appointment by
the governor of a qualified resident of the same district.  The convention shall have power to
appoint such officers, employees and assistants as it may deem necessary and to fix their
compensation, and to provide for the printing and distribution of its documents, journals and
proceedings.  Each delegate shall receive for his services the sum of one thousand dollars and the
same mileage as shall then be payable to members of the legislature, but such compensation may
be increased by law.  No proposed constitution or amendment adopted by such convention shall
be submitted to the electors for approval as hereinafter provided unless by the assent of a
majority of all the delegates elected to the convention, the yeas and nays being entered on the
journal.  Any proposed constitution or amendments adopted by such convention shall be
submitted to the qualified electors in the manner provided by such convention on the first
Monday in April following the final adjournment of the convention; but, in case an interval of at
least ninety days shall not intervene between such final adjournment and the date of such
election, then it shall be submitted at the next general election.  Upon the approval of such
constitution or amendments by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon such
constitution or amendments shall take effect on the first day of January following the approval
thereof.

proposing an amendment to this constitution shall be filed with the Secretary of State at least four
months before the election at which such proposed amendment is to be voted upon.  Upon receipt
of such petition by the Secretary of State he shall canvass the same to ascertain if such petition
has been signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, and if the same has been so signed,
the proposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors at the next regular election at which
any State officer is to be elected.  Any constitutional amendment initiated by the people as herein
provided, shall take effect and become a part of the constitution if the same shall be approved by
a majority of the electors voting thereon and not otherwise.  Every amendment shall take effect
thirty days after the election at which it is approved.  The total number of votes cast for Governor
at the regular election last preceding the filing of any petition proposing an amendment to the
constitution, shall be the basis upon which the number of legal voters necessary to sign such a
petition shall be computed.  The Secretary of State shall submit all proposed amendments to the
constitution initiated by the people for adoption or rejection in compliance herewith.  The
petition shall consist of sheets in such form and having printed or written at the top thereof such
heading as shall be designated or prescribed by the Secretary of State.  Such petition shall be
signed by qualified voters in person only with the residence address of such persons and the date
of signing the same.  To each of such petitions, which may consist of one or more sheets, shall be
attached the affidavit of the elector circulating the same, stating that each signature thereto is the
genuine signature of the person signing the same, and that to the best knowledge and belief of the
affiant each person signing the petition was at the time of signing a qualified elector.  Such
petition so verified shall be prima facie evidence that the signatures thereon are genuine, and that
the persons signing the same are qualified electors.  The text of all amendments to be submitted
shall be published as constitutional amendments are now required to be published.

Section 1. The legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate and house of
representatives; but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose legislative measures,
resolutions and laws; to enact or reject the same at the polls independently of the legislature; and
to approve or reject at the polls any act passed by the legislature, except acts making
appropriations for State institutions and to meet deficiencies in State funds.  The first power
reserved by the people is the initiative.  At least eight per cent of the legal voters of the State
shall be required to propose any measure by petition: Provided. That no law shall be enacted by
the initiative that could not under this constitution be enacted by the legislature.  Initiative
petitions shall set forth in full the proposed measure, and shall be filed with the Secretary of State
not less than ten days before the commencement of any session of the legislature.  Every petition
shall be certified to as herein provided as having been signed by qualified electors of the State
equal in number to eight per cent of the total vote cast for all candidates for Governor at the last
preceding general election, at which a Governor was elected.  Upon receipt of any initiative
petition, the Secretary of State shall canvass the same to ascertain if such petition has been signed
by the requisite number of qualified electors, and if the same has been so signed, the Secretary of
State shall transmit such petition to the legislature as soon as it convenes and organizes.  The law
proposed by such petition shall be either enacted or rejected by the legislature without change or
amendment within forty days from the time such petition is received by the legislature.  
     If any law proposed by such petition shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be subject
to referendum, as hereinafter provided.  If any law so petitioned for be rejected, or if no action is
taken upon it by the legislature within said forty days, the Secretary of State shall submit such
proposed law to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election.  The
legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different
measure upon the same subject by a yea and nay vote upon separate roll calls, and in such event
both measures shall be submitted by the Secretary of State to the electors for approval or
rejection at the next ensuing general election.  All said initiative petitions last above described
shall have printed thereon in twelve point black face type the following: "Initiative measure to be 
presented to the legislature."
     The second power reserved to the people is the referendum.  No act passed by the
legislature shall go into effect until ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the
legislature which passed such act, except such acts making appropriations and such acts
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety, as have been
given immediate effect by action of the legislature.
     Upon presentation to the Secretary of State within ninety days after the final adjournment
of the legislature, of a petition certified to as herein provided, as having been signed by qualified
electors equal in number to five per cent of the total vote cast for all candidates for Governor at
the last election at which a Governor was elected, asking that any act, section or part of any act of
the legislature, be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection, the Secretary of State, after
canvassing such petition as above required, and the same is found to be signed by the requisite
number of electors, shall submit to the electors for approval or rejection such act or section or
part of any act at the next succeeding general election; and no such act shall go into effect until
and unless approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon.  
     Any act submitted to the people by either initiative or referendum petition and approved
by a majority of the votes case thereon at any election shall take effect ten days after the date of
the official declaration of the vote by the Secretary of State.  No act initiated or adopted by the
people, shall be subject to the veto power of the Governor, and no act adopted by the people at
the polls under the initiative provisions of this section shall be amended or repealed, except by a
vote of the electors unless otherwise provided in said initiative measure, but the legislature may
propose such amendments, alterations or repeals to the people.  Acts adopted by the people under
the referendum provision of this section may be amended by the legislature at any subsequent
session thereof: Provided, however, If two or more measures approved by the electors at the same
election conflict, the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.  The text of all
measures to be submitted shall be published as constitutional amendments are required by law to
be published.
     Any initiative or referendum petition may be presented in sections, each section
containing a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed measure.  Each signer
thereto shall add to his signature, his place of residence, street and number in cities having street
numbers, and his election precinct.  Any qualified elector of the State shall be competent to
solicit such signatures within the county in which he is an elector.  Each section of the petition
shall bear the name of the county or city in which it is circulated, and only qualified electors of
such county or city shall be competent to sign such section.  Each section shall have attached
thereto the affidavit of the person soliciting signatures to the same, stating his own qualifications
and that all the signatures to the attached section were made in his presence, that each signature
to the section is the genuine signature of the person signing the same, and no other affidavit
thereto shall be required.  Such petitions so verified shall be prima facie evidence that the
signatures thereon are genuine and that the persons signing the same are qualified electors.
     Each section of the petition shall be filed with the clerk of the county in which it was
circulated, but all said sections circulated in any county shall be filed at the same time. Within
twenty days after the filing of such petition in his office, the said clerk shall forward said petition
to the Secretary of State.  Within forty days from the transmission of the said petition to the
Secretary of State, a supplemental petition identical with the original as to the body of the
petition but containing supplemental names, may be filed with the county clerk, and such
supplemental petition shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State by said clerk within ten days
after the filing of the same.

Sec. 1. The legislative power of the state of Michigan is vested in a senate and house of
representatives; but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose legislative measures,
resolutions and laws; to enact or reject the same at the polls independently of the legislature; and
to approve or reject at the polls any act passed by the legislature, except acts making
appropriations for state institutions and to meet deficiencies in state funds.  The first power
reserved by the people is the initiative.  Qualified and registered electors of the state equal in
number to at least 8 per cent of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor, at the last
preceding general election at which a governor was elected, shall be required to propose any
measure by petition: Provided, That no law shall be enacted by the initiative that could not under
this constitution be enacted by the legislature.  Initiative petitions shall set forth in full the
proposed measure, and shall be filed with the secretary of state or such other person or persons as
may hereafter be authorized by law to receive same not less then l0 days before the
commencement of any session of the legislature.  Every petition shall be certified to as herein
provided as having been signed by the required number of qualified and registered electors
of the state.  Upon receipt of any initiative petition, the secretary of state or such other person or
persons hereafter authorized by law shall canvass the same to ascertain if such petition has been
signed by the requisite number of qualified and registered electors, and may, in determining the
validity thereof, cause any doubtful signatures to be checked against the registration records by
the clerk of any political subdivision in which said petitions were circulated, for property
determining the authenticity of such signatures. If the same has been so signed, the secretary of
state or other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to receive and canvass same,
determines that the petition is legal and in proper form and has been signed by the required
number of qualified and registered electors, such petition shall be transmitted to the legislature as
soon as it convenes and organizes.  The law proposed by such petition shall be either enacted or
rejected by the legislature without change or amendment within 40 days from the time such
petition is received by the legislature. 
     If any law proposed by such petition shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be subject
to referendum, as hereinafter provided.  If any law so petitioned for be rejected, or if no action is
taken upon it by the legislature within said 40 days, the secretary of state or such other person or
persons hereafter authorized by law shall submit such proposed law to the people for approval or
rejection at the next ensuing general election.  The legislature may reject any measure so
proposed by initiative petition and propose a different measure upon the same subject by a yea
and nay vote upon separate roll calls, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the
secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to the electors for
approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election.  All said initiative petitions last above
described shall have printed thereon in 12 point black face type the following: "Initiative measure
to be presented to the legislature."
     The legislature may prescribe penalties for causing or aiding and abetting in causing any
fictitious or forged name to be affixed to any initiative of referendum petition, or for knowingly
causing any initiative or referendum petition bearing fictitious or forged names to be circulated.
     The second power reserved to the people is the referendum.  No act passed by the
legislature shall go into effect until 90 days after the final adjournment of the session of the
legislature which passed such act, except such acts making appropriations and such acts
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety, as have been
given immediate effect by action of the legislature.  Upon presentation to the secretary of state or
such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law, within 90 days after the final
adjournment of the legislature, of a petition certified to as herein provided, as having been signed
by qualified and registered electors equal in number to 5 per cent of the total vote cast for all
candidates for governor at the last election at which a governor was elected, asking that any act,
section or part of any act of the legislature, be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection,
the secretary of state or other person or persons hereafter authorized by law, shall canvass said
petition to ascertain if the same is signed by the requisite number of qualified and registered
electors.  The secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law may,
in determining the validity thereof, cause any doubtful signatures to be checked against the
registration records by the clerk of any political subdivision in which said petitions were
circulated, for properly determining the authenticity of such signatures.  If the secretary of state
or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to receive and canvass the same
determines that the petition is legal and in proper form and has been signed by the required
number of qualified and registered electors, he shall then submit to the electors for approval or
rejection such act or section or part of any act at the next succeeding general election; and no
such act shall go into effect until and unless approved by a majority of the qualified and
registered electors voting thereon.  An official declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of
the petition shall be made by the secretary of state or such other person or persons as shall
hereafter be authorized at least 2 months prior to such election.
     Any act submitted to the people by either initiative or referendum petition and approved
by a majority of the votes cast thereon at any election shall take effect 10 days after the date of
the official declaration of the vote by the secretary of state.  No act initiated or adopted by the
people, shall be subject to the veto power of the governor, and no act adopted by the people at the
polls under the initiative provisions of this section shall be amended or repealed, except by a vote
of the electors unless otherwise provided in said initiative measure, but the legislature may
propose such amendments, alternations or repeals to the people.  Acts adopted by the people
under the referendum provision of this section may be amended by the legislature at any
subsequent session thereof: Provided, however, If 2 or more measures approved by the electors at
the same election conflict, the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.  The
text of all measures to be submitted shall be published as constitutional amendments are required
by law to be published. 
     Any initiative or referendum petition may be presented in sections, each section
containing a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed measure.  Each signer
thereto shall add to his signature, his place of residence, street names and also residence numbers
in cities and villages having street numbers, and date of signing the same.  Any qualified and
registered elector of the state shall be competent to solicit such signatures within the county in
which he is an elector.  Each section of the petition shall bear the name of the county or city in
which it is circulated, and only qualified and registered electors of such county or city shall be
competent to sign such section.  Each section shall have attached thereto the affidavit of the
person soliciting signatures to the same, who shall be required to identify himself by affixing his
address below his signature, stating that he is a qualified and registered elector and that all the
signatures to the attached section were made in his presence, that each signature to the section is
the genuine signature of the person signing the same, and no other affidavit thereto shall be
required.  
     Each section of the petition shall be filed with the clerk of the county in which it was
circulated, but all said sections circulated in any county shall be filed at the same time.  Within
20 days after the filing of such petition in his office, the said clerk shall forward said petition to
the secretary of state or such other person or persons as shall hereafter be authorized by law.

Sec. 28. The state, in addition to any other borrowing power, may borrow from time to time such
amounts as shall be required, pledge its faith and credit and issue its notes or bonds therefor, for
the purpose of making loans to school districts as provided in this section.
     If the minimum amount which it would otherwise be necessary for a school district to
levy in any year to pay principal and interest on its qualified bonds, including any necessary
allowances for estimated tax delinquencies, exceeds 13 mills on each dollar of its assessed
valuation as last equalized by the state, or such lower millage as the legislature may prescribe,
then the school district may elect to borrow all or any part of the excess from the state.  In that
event the state shall loan the excess amount to the school district for the payment of principal and
interest.  If for any reason any school district will be or is unable to pay the principal and interest
on its qualified bonds when due, then the school district shall borrow and the state shall loan to it

section.
     After a school district has received loans from the state, each year thereafter it shall levy
for debt service, exclusive of levies for nonqualified bonds, not less than 13 mills or such lower
millage as the legislature may prescribe, until the amount loaned has been repaid, and any tax
collections therefrom in any year over and above the minimum requirements for principal and
interest on qualified bonds shall be used towards the repayment of state loans.  In any year when
such a levy would produce an amount in excess of the requirements and the amount due to the
state, the levy may be reduced by the amount of the excess.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions, the legislature shall have the power to prescribe
and/or limit the procedure, terms and conditions for the qualification of bonds, for obtaining and
making state loans, and for the repayment of loans.
     The power to tax for the payment of principal and interest on bonds hereafter issued
which are the general obligations of any school district, including refunding bonds, and for
repayment of any state loans made pursuant to this section, shall be without limitation as to rate
or amount.

among said school districts by law.  Such taxes so collected shall be deposited in a special school
aid fund and be expendable only by legislative appropriations for aid to the school districts and
school employees' retirement purposes as shall be provided by law.  Said school aid fund shall be
separate and distinct from the state general fund.
     Prior to any division or allocation of the sales tax, the cost of collection as determined by
the department of revenue shall be deducted from total collections and credited to the general
fund of the state.
     The legislature shall by law appropriate from the school aid fund for such public school
employees' retirement systems as shall from time to time be in effect under the laws of this state
an amount which shall not be less than 5% nor more than 7 1/2% of the salaries of school district
employees participating in the respective retirement systems.  Such percentages shall apply only
to that portion of salary as may be provided by law.  At no time shall the legislature levy a sales
tax of more than 4%.
