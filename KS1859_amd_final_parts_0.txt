  applicable uniformly to all cities, to enactments of the legislature applicable uniformly to

  All enactments relating to cities now in effect or hereafter enacted and as later amended

  other than enactments of statewide concern applicable uniformly to all cities, other
  enactments applicable uniformly to all cities, and enactments prescribing limits of
  indebtedness, shall not apply to such city.
              (2)   A charter ordinance is an ordinance which exempts a city from the whole or
  any part of any enactment of the legislature as referred to in this section and which may
  provide substitute and additional provisions on the same subject. Such charter ordinance
  shall be so titled, shall designate specifically the enactment of the legislature or part thereof
  made inapplicable to such city by the adoption of such ordinance and contain the substitute
  and additional provisions, if any, and shall require a two-thirds vote of the members-elect
  of the governing body of such city. Every charter ordinance shall be published once each
  week for two consecutive weeks in the official city newspaper or, if there is none, in a
  newspaper of general circulation in the city.
              (3)   No charter ordinance shall take effect until sixty days after its final publication.
  If within sixty days of its final publication a petition signed by a number of electors of the
  city equal to not less than ten percent of the number of electors who voted at the last
  preceding regular city election shall be filed in the office of the clerk of such city
  demanding that such ordinance be submitted to a vote of the electors, it shall not take effect
  until submitted to a referendum and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon.
  An election, if called, shall be called within thirty days and held within ninety days after
  the filing of the petition. The governing body shall pass an ordinance calling the election
  and fixing the date, which ordinance shall be published once each week for three
  consecutive weeks in the official city newspaper or, if there be none, in a newspaper of
  general circulation in the city, and the election shall be conducted as elections for officers
  and by the officers handling such elections. The proposition shall be: "Shall charter
  ordinance No._____ , entitled (title of ordinance) take effect?" The governing body may
  submit any charter ordinance to a referendum without petition by the same publication of
  the charter ordinance and the same publication of the ordinance calling the election as for
  ordinances upon petition and such charter ordinance shall then become effective when
  approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. Each charter ordinance becoming
  effective shall be recorded by the clerk in a book maintained for that purpose with a
  statement of the manner of adoption and a certified copy shall be filed with the secretary of
  state, who shall keep an index of the same.
              (4) Each charter ordinance enacted shall control and prevail over any prior or
  subsequent act of the governing body of the city and may be repealed or amended only by    
     charter ordinance or by enactments of the legislature applicable to all cities.
  (d) Powers and authority granted cities pursuant to this section shall be liberally
  construed for the purpose of giving to cities the largest measure of self-government.
