such justice or judge for disability that seriously interferes with the performance of his duties and
is or is likely to become permanent, and (2) censure or remove such justice or judge, for action
occurring not more than six years prior to the commencement of his current term, when such
action constitutes willful misconduct in office, willful and persistent failure to perform his duties,
habitual intemperance, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the

as follows:
    (1) He may sign it, in which event it shall become a law.

        (A) In the event of a veto while the General Assembly is in session, he shall return such bill,
with his objections, within seven days of presentment, to the House in which it originated. If the
Governor does not return the bill within seven days of presentment, the bill becomes a law

        (B) If the Governor returns the bill under clause (A), the House in which the bill originated
shall enter the Governor's objections at large upon its journals and proceed to reconsider and vote
upon whether to approve the bill. The bill must be reconsidered and voted upon within the time
set out in clause (C). If, after such reconsideration and vote, a majority of all the members elected
to that House shall approve the bill, it shall be sent, with the Governor's objections, to the other
House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered and voted upon, and, if approved by a majority
of all the members elected to that House, it shall be a law.
        (C) If the Governor returns the bill under clause (A), the General Assembly shall reconsider
and vote upon the approval of the bill before the final adjournment of the next regular session of
the General Assembly that follows the regular or special session in which the bill was originally
passed. If the House in which the bill originated does not approve the bill under clause (B), the
other House is not required to reconsider and vote upon the approval of the bill. If, after voting,
either House fails to approve the bill within this time, the veto is sustained.
        (D) In the event of a veto after final adjournment of a session of the General Assembly, such
bill shall be returned by the Governor to the House in which it originated on the first day that the
General Assembly is in session after such adjournment, which House shall proceed in the same
manner as with a bill vetoed before adjournment. The bill must be reconsidered and voted upon
within the time set out in clause (C). If such bill is not so returned, it shall be a law
notwithstanding such veto.
    (3) He may refuse to sign or veto such bill in which event it shall become a law without his
signature on the eighth day after presentment to the Governor.
    (b) Every bill presented to the Governor which is signed by him or on which he fails to act
within said seven days after presentment shall be filed with the Secretary of State within ten days
of presentment. The failure to so file shall not prevent such a bill from becoming a law.
    (c) In the event a bill is passed over the Governor's veto, such bill shall be filed with the
Secretary of State without further presentment to the Governor, provided that, in the event of
such passage over the Governor's veto in the next succeeding General Assembly, the passage shall
be deemed to have been the action of the General Assembly which initially passed such bill.
