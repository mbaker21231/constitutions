Executive Secretary of the Oklahoma Bar Association when directed so to do by a vote of a
majority
of all members of its Executive Council; or by Resolution of the House of Delegates or by
Resolution of
the House of Representatives of the State of Oklahoma.  The petition shall state the name of the
respondent; the grounds upon which his removal from office or compulsory retirement from
office is
sought; and such other matters as may be specified by the rules of the Trial Division.  It shall be
subject
to amendment by order of either division of the Court.

   (b) Immediately upon the filing of the petition, the Clerk shall notify the presiding officer of
the Trial
Division, and the respondent named therein, in accordance with the rules of the Trial Division. 
The
presiding judge of the Trial Division shall secure from the Executive Council of the Oklahoma
Bar
Association a panel of five (5) active members of the Association from which the presiding judge
shall
designate the prosecutor, and any necessary assistant, to conduct the proceeding against the
respondent.  

   (c) The Trial Division or the presiding judge shall set the matter for hearing, not less than sixty
(60)
days after notice of the filing of the petition shall have been given the respondent.  In all
procedural
matters not covered by rule of the Trial Division, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure,
or of
the common law of Oklahoma, shall be followed, so far as they may be applicable.  

   (d) Pending the determination of the proceedings, the Trial Division in its discretion may
suspend the
respondent from the exercise of his office.  After full hearing, the Trial Division shall render such
judgment as the facts may justify.  No judgment shall extend further than: (1) to removal of the
respondent from office, with or without disqualification to hold any public office of honor, trust,
or profit
under this State, or (2) to compulsory retirement from office; but such a proceeding, regardless of
result, shall not bar or prejudice any other proceeding, civil or criminal, authorized by law.  A
judicial
officer who is a member of the retirement compensation system prescribed by this Article and is
compulsory retired shall receive the retirement compensation to which his term of service
entitled him. 
If he is not qualified for full retirement compensation, he may receive such compensation as the
Court
may decree, in proportion to time served and in accordance with principles of justice and equity,
alike
as to amount, commencement of payment, terms of payment, or other relevant conditions or

Article 9, section 20
20.  From any action of the Corporation Commission prescribing rates, charges, services,
practices,
rules or regulations of any public utility or public service corporation, or any individual, person,
firm,
corporation, receiver or trustee engaged in the public utility business, an appeal may be taken by
any
party affected, or by any person deeming himself aggrieved by any such action, or by the State,
directly
to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, in the manner and in the same time in which
appeals
may be taken to the Supreme Court from the District Courts, except that such an appeal shall be
of
right, and the Supreme Court may provide by rule for proceedings in the matter of appeals in any
particular in which the existing rules of law are inapplicable.  If such appeal be taken by the
public utility
or public service corporation affected by any such action, the State of Oklahoma shall be made
the
appellee, but in other appeals hereunder, the public utility or public service corporation affected
shall be
made the appellee.
   An appeal from an order of the Corporation Commission affecting the rates, charges, services,
practices, rules or regulations of public utilities, or public service corporations, shall be to the
Supreme
Court only, and in all appeals to which the State is a party it shall be represented by the Attorney
for
the Corporation Commission, and the Attorney General, or his duly authorized representative.
   The Supreme Court's review of appealable orders of the Corporation Commission shall be
judicial
only, and in all appeals involving an asserted violation of any right of the parties under the
Constitution
of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma, the Court shall exercise its
own
independent judgment as to both the law and the facts.  In all other appeals 
from orders of the Corporation Commission the review by the Supreme Court shall not extend
further
than to determine whether the Commission has regularly pursued its authority, and whether the
findings
and conclusions of the Commission are sustained by the law and substantial evidence.  Upon
review,
the Supreme Court shall enter judgment, either affirming or reversing the order of the
Commission
appealed from.
   No court of this State, except the Supreme Court, shall have jurisdiction to review, affirm,
reverse, or
remand any action of the Corporation Commission with respect to the rates, charges, services,
practices, rules or regulations of public utilities, or of public service corporations, or to suspend
or delay
the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, reverse, or interfere with the Corporation
Commission
in the performance of its official duties; provided, however, that writs of mandamus or
prohibition shall
lie from the Supreme Court to the Corporation Commission in all cases where such writs
respectively
would lie to nay inferior court or officer.

Article 9, section 21
21. Upon the giving of notice of appeal from an order of the Corporation Commission, the
Commission, if requested, shall suspend the effectiveness of the order complained of until the
final
disposition of the order appealed, and fix the amount of suspending or supersedeas bond.  Such
suspending or supersedeas bond shall be approved and filed with the Corporation Commission
(or
approved, on review, by the Supreme Court), and made payable to the State of Oklahoma;
provided,
however, that in all cases involving orders of the Corporation Commission affecting rates or
charges,
the suspending or supersedeas bond must be sufficient in amount and security to insure the
prompt
refunding, by the appealing party, to the parties entitled thereto, of all rates or charges which
such
appealing party may collect or receive, pending the appeal, in excess of those authorized by the
order
appealed from, in event such order is, by such court, affirmed on appeal.  The Corporation
Commission, upon the execution of such suspending or supersedeas bond, shall forthwith require
the
appealing party, under penalty of immediate enforcement (pending the appeal and
notwithstanding any
supersedeas), of the order appealed from, to keep such accounts, and make to the Corporation
Commission, from time to time, such reports, verified by oath, as may, in the judgment of the
Corporation Commission, suffice to show the amounts being charged or received by the
appealing
party, pending the appeal, in excess of the charge allowed by the order or action of the
Corporation
Commission appealed from, together with the names and addresses of the persons to whom such
overcharges may be refundable, in case such charges made by the appealing party, pending the
appeal,
be not sustained on such appeal; and the Corporation Commission shall also, from time to time,
require
such appealing party, under like penalty, to give additional security, or to increase such
suspending
bond, whenever, in the opinion of the Corporation Commission, the same may be necessary to
secure
the prompt refunding of the overcharges aforesaid.  Upon the final decision of the appeal, all
amounts
which the appealing party may have collected, pending the appeal, in excess of that authorized by
such
final decision, shall be promptly refunded by the appealing party to the parties entitled thereto, in
such
manner and through such method of distribution, as may be prescribed by the Corporation
Commission, or by law.  All such appeals, affecting the rates, charges, practices, rules or
regulations of
any public utility, or of any public service corporation, or any individual, person, firm,
corporation,
receiver or trustee engaged in the public utility business, shall have precedence upon the docket
of the
Supreme Court, irrespective of its place of session, next after habeas corpus cases, to the end that
a
plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be afforded the parties to such appeals.

Article 10, section 8
8.  All property which may be taxed ad valorem shall be assessed for taxation at its fair cash
value,
estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary sale, except real property and tangible
personal
property shall not be assessed for taxation at more than thirty-five percent (35%) of its fair cash
value,
estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary sale.  Provided, however, that no real
property
shall be assessed for ad valorem taxation at a value greater than thirty-five percent (35%) of its
fair cash
value for the highest and best use for which such property was actually used, or was previously
classified
for use, during the calendar year next preceding the first day of January on which the assessment
is
made.  Provided, further, that the transfer of property without a change in its use classification
shall not
require a reassessment based exclusively upon the sale value of such property.  In connection
with the
foregoing, the Legislature shall be empowered to enact laws defining classifications of use for
the
purpose of applying standards to facilitate uniform assessment procedures in this state.  Any
officer or
other person authorized to assess values or subjects for taxation, who shall commit any wilful
error in the

9.  (a) Except as herein otherwise provided, that total taxes for all purposes on an ad valorem
basis shall
not exceed, in any taxable year, fifteen (15) mills on the dollar, no less than five (5) mills of
which is
hereby apportioned for school district purposes, the remainder to be apportioned between county,
city,
town and school district, by the County Excise Board, until such time as a regular apportionment
thereof
is otherwise provided for by the Legislature.

   No ad valorem tax shall be levied for State purposes, nor shall any part of the proceeds of any
ad
valorem tax upon any kind of property in this State be used for State purposes.  

   (b) A tax of four (4) mills on the dollar valuation of all taxable property in the county shall be
levied
annually in each county of the State for school purposes and, until otherwise provided by law, the
proceeds thereof shall be apportioned to the school districts of the county by the County
Treasurer on
the basis of the legal average daily attendance for the preceding school year as certified by the
State
Board of Education.  Provided that in case a school district lies in more than one county, such
district
shall be deemed a school district of the county having the greater part of the area comprising
such
district, unless otherwise provided by law, and shall be entitled to participate in the proceeds of
such tax
on the same basis as districts lying wholly within such county but revenue from such tax on the
assessed
valuation of the district in other counties shall, when collected, be transmitted to the County
Treasurer of
such county having the greater part of the area comprising the district, unless otherwise provided
by law,
and be apportioned as hereinbefore provided for the proceeds of such tax on the assessed
valuation of
such county.  Not to exceed seventy-five per centum (75%) of the amount received by a school
district
from the proceeds of such county levy in any year shall be required to finance the State
guaranteed
program of such district.

   (c) Upon certification of a need therefor by the board of education of any school district an
additional
tax of not to exceed fifteen (15) mills on the dollar valuation of all taxable property in the district
shall be
levied for the benefit of the schools of such district.

    (d) In addition to the levies hereinbefore authorized any school district may make an
emergency levy
for the benefit of the schools of such district, in an amount not to exceed five (5) mills on the
dollar
valuation of the taxable property in such district when approved by a majority of the electors of
the
district voting on the question at an election called for such purpose.  This emergency levy shall
provide
only sufficient additional revenue to meet the needs of the district each fiscal year as determined
by the
board of such district and must be approved by a majority of the electors voting on said question
at such
an election for each fiscal year.

   (d-1) In addition to the levies hereinbefore authorized, any school district may make a local
support
levy for the benefit of the schools of such district, in an amount not to exceed ten (10) mills on
the dollar
valuation of the taxable property in such district, when approved by a majority of the ad valorem
taxpaying voters voting on said question at an election for each fiscal year called for such
purposes.  This
local support levy shall provide only sufficient additional revenue to meet the needs of the
district for
each such fiscal year as determined by the board of such district; provided, an elector desiring to
vote
upon such local support levy must present an ad valorem tax receipt for the year immediately
preceding
before being issued a ballot, or sign a sworn affidavit certifying the fact of such payment.

   (e) The amount of revenue from school district ad valorem taxes levied under (a) and (c) of this
Section which any school district may be required to use to finance its State guaranteed program
shall
not be in excess of its share, based upon its relative taxpaying ability as may be defined by law,
of an
amount equivalent to the net proceeds from a fifteen (15) mill tax levy on the aggregate net
assessed
valuation of the State; but until such relative taxpaying ability is defined by the Legislature, the
amount of
revenue from such taxes which any school district may be required to use to finance its State
guaranteed
program shall not be in excess of the net proceeds from an ad valorem tax levy of fifteen (15)
mills on
the dollar net assessed valuation of the district.  No part of the proceeds from any ad valorem
levy for
emergency levy and local support levy under (d) and (d-1) of this Section shall be required to
finance the
State guaranteed program of such district.

   Nothing in the amendments to the Constitution incorporated herein shall be construed to
amend, alter
or supersede the present application of Article XII-A, Sections 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma
Constitution.

    (f) Should the amendment contained in subsection (d-1) hereof be adopted on September 14,
1965,
the school board of any school district in the State may within ten (10) days thereafter file with
the
Excise Board of the county a supplemental estimate of needs and call a special election within
fifteen
(15) days after such call upon the new local support levy or emergency levy if not previously
submitted,
or both.  The school board shall advertise notice of such election by publication in at least one
issue of a
newspaper having general circulation in the school district, or by posting in five public places in
the
district at least five (5) days before such election.  Should the electors of the school district vote
such
additional levy in such election, the County Excise Board shall forthwith compute the levy and
certify
appropriations for all affected school districts and refile the budgets with the County Clerk and
with the
State Auditor.  Notice of the filing of said budget shall be given as required by law.  The forty
(40) day
protest period shall begin immediately upon the filing of said budgets.

   For the fiscal year 1965-66, the Excise Board of each county shall not finally compute the levy
nor
certify the appropriations for the school districts of the State until after the school district shall
have had
the opportunity to hold a special election as provided herein.

   Temporary appropriations, up to forty per centum (40%) of the estimated funds needed by the
school
board of any district in the State for the fiscal year 1965-66, may be approved any time after the
beginning of such fiscal year.

   Upon the computation of the levy and certification of appropriations by the Excise Board, the
County
Assessor shall prepare or revise the tax rolls and deliver the same to the County Treasurer who
shall
proceed with the collection of the taxes as a required by law.

   Should it become necessary, because of the delay in computing levies and certifying
appropriations as
herein provided, the Governor may, by executive order, extend the time when taxes will be
delinquent
for the year of 1965, and that year only.  Such extension of time shall be for the minimum time
necessary
to permit the County Assessor and County Treasurer to perform their duties as required by law.

Article 10, section 9C
9C.  (a) The board of county commissioners, or boards if more than one county is involved, may
call a
special election to determine whether or not an ambulance service district shall be formed.  An
election
shall also be called by the board or boards involved upon petition signed by not less than ten
percent
(10%) of the registered voters of the area affected.  Said area may embrace a county, a part
thereof, or
more than one county or parts thereof, and in the event the area covers only a part or parts of one
or
more counties, the area must follow school district boundary lines.  All registered voters in such
area
shall be entitled to vote, as to whether or not such district shall be formed, and at the same time
and in
the same question authorize a tax levy not to exceed three (3) mills for the purpose of providing
funds for
the purpose of support, organization, operation and maintenance of district ambulance services,
known
as emergency medical service districts and hereinafter referred to as "districts."  If the formation
of the
district and the mill levy is approved by a majority of the votes cast, a special annual recurring ad
valorem tax levy of not more than three (3) mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of all
taxable
property in the district shall be levied.  The number of mills shall be set forth in the election
proclamation,
and may be increased in a later election, not to exceed a total levy of three (3) mills.  This special
levy
shall be in a addition to all other levies and when authorized shall be made each fiscal year
thereafter.

   Each district which is herein authorized, or established, shall have a board of trustees
composed of not
less than five members.  Such trustees shall be chosen jointly by the board or boards of county
commissioners, provided that such membership shall be composed of not less than one
individual from
each county or part thereof which is included in said district.

   Original members of the board of trustees shall hold office, as follows: At the first meeting of
said
board, board members shall draw lots to determine each trustee's original length of term in office. 
The
number of lots to be provided shall be equal to the number of original members of the board, and
lots
shall be numbered sequentially from one through five, with lots in excess of the fifth lot being
also
numbered sequentially from one through five until all lots are numbered.  Each original member
or
members added by an expansion area of the board shall hold office for the number of years
indicated on
his or her lot.  Each year, as necessary, the board or boards of county commissioners shall
appoint
successors to such members of the board of trustees whose terms have expired, and such
subsequent
appointments shall be for terms of five (5) years.

   Such board of trustees shall have the power and duty to promulgate and adopt such rules,
procedures
and contract provisions necessary to carry out the purposes and objectives of these provisions,
and shall
individually post such bond as required by the county commissioners, which shall not be less
than Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000.0).

   The district board of trustees shall have the additional powers to hire a manager and
appropriate
personnel, contract, organize, maintain or otherwise operate the emergency medical services
within said
district and such additional powers as may be authorized by the Legislature.

   (b) Any district board of trustees may issue bonds, if approved by a majority vote at a special
election
for such purpose.  All registered voters within the designated district shall have the right to vote
in said
election.  Such bonds shall be issued for the purpose of acquiring emergency vehicles and other
equipment and maintaining and housing the same.

   (c) The bonds authorized above shall not bear interest at a greater rate than that authorized by
statute
for the issuance of city municipal bonds.  Such bonds shall be sold only at public sale after
twenty (20)
days' advertisement in a newspaper for publication of legal notices with circulation in the district. 
Any
district may refund its bonds as is now provided by law for refunding municipal bonds.

   (d) Any district board of trustees, upon issuing bonds as authorized in subsection (b) of this
section,
shall levy a special annual ad valorem tax upon the property within the district, payable annually,
in a
total amount not to exceed three (3) mills on the dollar, on the real and personal taxable property
in such
district, for the payment of principal and interest on outstanding bonds, until same are paid. 
However,
the trustees may, from time to time, suspend the collection of such annual levy when not required
for the
payment of the bonds.  In no event shall the real and personal taxable property in any city or
town be
subject to a special tax in excess of three (3) mills for the payment of bonds issued hereunder.

   (e) There may also be pledged to the payment of principal and interest of the bonds herein
authorized
to be issued: (1) any net proceeds from operation of the district that the board of trustees of the
district
shall deem not necessary to the future operation and maintenance of said emergency medical
service; or
(2) any monies available from other funds of the district not otherwise obligated.

   (f) Bonds shall be issued for designated sums with serial numbers thereon and maturing
annually after
three (3) years from date of issue.  All bonds and interest thereon shall be paid upon maturity and
no
bonds shall be issued for a period longer than thirty (30) years.  Any district board of trustees
may in its
discretion schedule the payment of principal over the thirty-year period so that when interest is
added
there will be approximately level annual payments of principal and interest.

   (g) In the event the mill levy as set forth in the original election proclamation is less than three
(3) mills,
the board of trustees may request the county commissioners to call a subsequent election to
consider
increasing the mill levy; provided, however, the total levy authorized by subsection (a) hereof
shall not
exceed three (3) mills.

   (h) The board of trustees of any district shall have jurisdiction over the sale or refunding of any
bonds
issued by the district and shall be responsible for the economical expenditure of the funds
derived from
the bonds.

   (i) Such district shall be empowered to charge fees for services, and accept gifts, funds or
grants from
sources other than the mill levy, which shall be used and accounted for in a like manner.  Persons
served
outside the district shall be charged an amount equal to the actual costs for the service, not taking
into
account any income the district receives from millage or sources within the district.  The board of
trustees shall have legal authority to bring suits necessary to collect accounts owed and to sue
and
defend as necessary for the protection of the board.  The State Examiner and Inspector shall
conduct an
annual audit of the operations of such districts.

   (j) Any emergency medical service district may expand to include other counties or parts
thereof,
provided that an election is called by the county commissioners whose county or counties, or
parts
thereof, are to be added to in the established district; and provided further, that the county
commissioners in the original district concur in the calling of said election.  The proposed
expansion area
shall only be added to the original district if approved separately by a majority vote, by the voters
in both
the original district and in the expansion area, at an election called for that purpose.  The county
in which
the expansion area is located shall have not less than one member on the board of trustees. 
Appropriate
millage or other approved method of financial support shall be levied in the expansion area,
when said
area is added to the original district which millage shall be levied at the rate used to cover
operational
costs and outstanding bonded indebtedness as provided in Section 9C, (d) and (e), Article X.

   (k) Any district may be dissolved, or the millage levy changed, by a majority vote of the
registered
votes voting a an election called for that purpose by the county commissioners of each county or
part
thereof included within the district; provided that such an election shall not be called unless
either three-
fifths ( 3/5) of the trustees of such district request the county commissioners to call such an
election, or
the respective county commissioners are presented a petition signed by not less than twenty
(20%) of all
registered voters in the district.

   (l) In the event a district is dissolved, any mill levy used to support, organize, operate and
maintain the
emergency medical service district shall cease, provided that such mill levy shall not cease until
all
outstanding emergency medical service bonds of that district are retired and all other debts
incurred by
the emergency medical service district have been satisfied.

   (m) All elections called under the provisions hereof shall be conducted by the county election
board or
boards of each county or counties involved, upon receipt of an election proclamation, issued by a
majority of the board or boards of county commissioners in the area affected.  In the event more
than
one county is involved, said proclamation must be a joint proclamation from a majority of the
board of
county commissioners of each county involved.  Said proclamation shall be published in one
issue of a
newspaper of general circulation in each county involved in the area affected at least ten (10)
days prior
to said election, and said proclamation shall set forth the purpose of the election, and the date
thereof. 
The county election board or boards shall certify the results of an election to the board or boards
issuing
such proclamation.

   (n) The board of any district shall have capacity to sue and be sued.  Provided, however, the
board
shall enjoy immunity from civil suit for actions or omissions arising from the operation of the
district, so
long as, and to the same extent as, municipalities and counties within the state enjoy such
immunity.

   (o) In lieu of proceeding to establish a district as outlined hereinabove through the county
commissioners, the governing body of any incorporated city or town may proceed to form a
district, join
an existing district or join with other incorporated cities or towns in forming a district.  In such
case, said
governing body shall be considered as being substituted as to the powers and duties of said
county
commissioners as set forth hereinabove; provided, further, said city or town shall be considered
as being
substituted as to the powers and duties of a district formed, as set forth hereinabove.  All rights,

and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  The Legislature shall not pass or enact any
bill, act or
measure making an appropriation of money for any purpose until such estimate is made and
filed, unless
the State Board of Equalization has failed to file said estimate at the time of convening of said
Legislature, then, in such event, it shall be the duty of the Legislature to make such estimate
pursuant to
the provisions of this amendment, and all appropriations made in excess of such estimate shall
be null
and void; provided, however, that the Legislature may at any regular session or special session,
called
for that purpose, enact laws to provide for additional revenues or a reduction in revenues, other
than ad
valorem taxes, or transferring the existing revenues or unappropriated case on hand from one
fund to
another.  Whereupon, it shall be the duty of the State Board of Equalization to make an estimate
of the
revenues that will accrue under such laws and to file the same with the Governor, with the
President and
President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the
amount
of any increase  or decrease resulting, for any reason, from such laws shall be added to or
deducted
from each respective fund, as the case may be.  The amount of such adjusted estimate shall be the
maximum amount which can be appropriated for all purposes from any fund for the fiscal year
estimated.

   That portion of every appropriation, at the end of each fiscal year, in excess of actual revenues
collected and allocated thereto, as hereinafter provided, shall be null and void.  Revenues
deposited in
the State Treasury to the credit of the General Revenue Fund or of any special fund (which
derives its
revenue in whole or in part from state taxes or fees) shall, except as to principal and interest on
the
public debt, be allocated monthly to each department, institution, board, commission or special
appropriation on a percentage basis, in that ratio that the total appropriation for such department,
institution, board, commission or special appropriation from each fund for that fiscal year bears
to the
total of all appropriations from each fund for that fiscal year, and no warrant shall be issued in
excess of
said allocation.  Any department, institution or agency of the state operating on revenues derived
from
any law or laws which allocate the revenues thereof to such department, institution or agency
shall not
incur obligations in excess of the unencumbered balance of cash on hand.  The Legislature shall
provide
a method whereby appropriations shall be divided and set up on a monthly, quarterly or
semiannual
basis within each fiscal year to prevent obligations being incurred in excess of the revenue to be
collected, and notwithstanding other provisions of this Constitution, the Legislature shall provide
that all
appropriations shall be reduced to bring them within revenues actually collected, but all such
reductions
shall apply to each department, institution, board, commission or special appropriation made by
the
State Legislature in the ratio that its total appropriation for that fiscal year bears to the total of all
appropriations for that fiscal year; provided, however, that the Governor may in his discretion
issue a
deficiency certificate or certificates to the State Auditor for the benefit of any department,
institution or
agency of the state, if the amount of such deficiency certificate or certificates be within the limit
of the
current appropriation for that department, institution or agency, whereupon the State Auditor
shall issue
warrants to the extent of such certificate or certificates for the payment of such claims as may be
authorized by the Governor, and such warrants shall become a part of the public debt and shall be
paid
out of any money appropriated by the Legislature and made lawfully available therefor; provided
further,
that in no event shall said deficiency certificate or certificates exceed in the aggregate the sum of
Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.0) in any fiscal year.

   The state shall never create or authorize the creation of any debt or obligation, or fund or pay
any
deficit, against the state, or any department, institution or agency thereof, regardless of its form
or the
source of money from which it is to be paid, except as provided in this amendment and in
Sections 24

23A.  Any surplus which has accrued or may hereafter accrue to the General Revenue Fund of
the State
of Oklahoma during any fiscal year shall be placed monthly in a sinking fund in the State
Treasury to be
used solely for the purpose of paying the principal and interest of the outstanding and unpaid
bonded

Accounts of the State Funding Bond Funds of 1935, 1939, and 1941 also shall be placed in said
Sinking Fund.  The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of said Sinking Fund and shall apply

of the

General shall have the authority to invest the monies in said sinking fund in bonds or securities
of the
United States of America, and the State Treasurer with the approval of the Governor and
Attorney
General may sell said securities to provide funds to meet maturing State bonds and coupons.  The
provisions of this section shall be self-executing.  When the monies credited to said sinking fund
together
with the monies set aside to pay said bonded indebtedness, pursuant to the statues authorizing the
issuance of said bonds, are sufficient to pay all outstanding bonds and coupons heretofore issued
by the
State of Oklahoma, it shall no longer be necessary to credit surplus funds to the Sinking Fund
herein
created.  The sufficiency of said monies to fully pay the State's bonded indebtedness shall be
determined
by the Governor, State Treasurer, and Attorney General.  After such determination any surplus
monies
thereafter to the credit of the State General Revenue Fund shall be subject to appropriation by the
Legislature.
