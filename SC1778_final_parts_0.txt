CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH CAROLINA-1778

An Act for establishing the constitution of the State of South Carolina,

Whereas the constitution or form of government agreed to and resolved upon by the freemen of
this country, met in congress, the twenty-sixth day of March, one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-six, was temporary only, and suited to the situation of their public affairs at that period,
looking forward to in accommodation with Great Britain, an event then desired; and whereas the
United Colonies of America, have been since constituted independent States, and the political
connection heretofore subsisting between them and Great Britain entirely dissolved by the
declaration of the honorable the Continental Congress, dated the fourth day of July, one thousand
seven hundred and seventy-six, for the many great, and weighty reasons therein particularly set
forth: It therefore becomes absolutely necessary to frame a constitution suitable to that great
event.
Be it therefore constituted and enacted, by his excellency Rawlins Lowndes, esq., president, and
commander-in-chief in and over the State of South Carolina, by the honorable the legislative
council and general assembly, and by the authority of the same:
That the following articles, agreed upon by the freemen of this State, now met in general
assembly  be deemed and held the constitution and form of government of the said State, unless
altered by the legislative authority thereof, which constitution or form of government shall
immediately take place and be in force from the passing of this act, excepting such parts as are
hereafter mentioned and specified.

Protestants in this State, demeaning themselves peaceably and faithfully, shall enjoy equal

property of those societies of Christians which are by law already incorporated for the purpose of
religions worship, and to put it fully into the power of every other society of Christian
Protestants, either already formed or hereafter to be formed, to obtain the like incorporation, it is
hereby constituted, appointed, and declared that the respective societies of the Church of England
that are already formed in this State for the purpose of religious worship shall still continue
incorporate and hold the religious property now in their possession. And that whenever fifteen or
more male persons, not under twenty-one years of age, professing the Christian Protestant
religion, and agreeing to unite themselves in a society for the purposes of religious worship, they

the legislature shall be entitled to be incorporated and to enjoy equal privileges. That every
society of Christians so formed shall give themselves a name or denomination by which they
shall be called and known in law, and, all that associate with them for the purposes of worship
shall be esteemed as belonging to the society so called. But that previous to the establishment and
incorporation of the respective societies of every denomination as aforesaid, and in order to
entitle them thereto, each society so petitioning shall have agreed to and subscribed in a book the
following five articles, without which no agreement or union of men upon pretence of religion
shall entitle them to be incorporated and esteemed as a church of the established religion of this
State:
1st.  That there is one eternal God, and a future state of rewards and punishments.
2d. That God is publicly to be worshipped.
3d. That the Christian religion is the true religion.
4th. That the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are of divine inspiration, and are the
rule of faith and practice.
5th. That it is lawful and the duty of every man being thereunto called by those that govern, to
bear witness to the truth.
And that every inhabitant of this State, when called to make an appeal to God as a witness to
truth, shall be permitted to do it in that way which is most agreeable to the dictates of his own
conscience. And that the people of this State may forever enjoy the right of electing their own
pastors or clergy, and at the same time that the State may have sufficient security for the due
discharge of the pastoral office, by those who shall be admitted to be clergymen, no person shall
officiate as minister of any established church who shall not have been chosen by a majority of
the society to which he shall minister, or by persons appointed by the said majority, to choose
and procure a minister for them; nor until the minister so chosen and appointed shall have made
and subscribed to the following declaration, over and above the aforesaid five articles, viz: "That
he is determined by God's grace out of the holy scriptures, to instruct the people committed to his
charge, and to teach nothing as required of necessity to eternal salvation but that which he shall
be persuaded may be concluded and proved from the scripture; that he will use both public and
private admonitions, as well to the sick as to the whole within his cure, as need shall require and
occasion shall be given, and that he will be diligent in prayers, and in reading of the same; that he
will be diligent to frame and fashion his own self and his family according to the doctrine of
Christ, and to make both himself and them, as much as in him lieth, wholesome examples and
patterns to the flock of Christ; that he will maintain and set forwards, as much as he can,
quietness, peace, and love among all people, and especially among those that are or shall be
committed to his charge. No person shall disturb or molest any religious assembly; nor shall use
any reproachful, reviling, or abusive language against any church, that being the certain way of
disturbing the peace, and of hindering the conversion of any to the truth, by engaging them in
quarrels and animosities, to the hatred of the professors, and that profession which otherwise they
might be brought to assent to. No person whatsoever shall speak anything in their religious
assembly irreverently or seditiously of the government of this State. No person shall, by law, be
obliged to pay towards the maintenance and support of a religious worship that he does not freely
join in, or has not voluntarily engaged to support. But the churches, chapels, parsonages, glebes,
and all other property now belonging to any societies of the Church of England, or any other
religious societies, shall remain and be secured to them forever. The poor shall be supported, and
elections managed in the accustomed manner, until laws shall be provided to adjust those matters
in the most equitable way.
