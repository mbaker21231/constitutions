Declaration of Rights

That the general, great and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized
and unalterably established, WE DECLARE THAT   

*** SSTART 001.0 001.0 0 PA 1969 ***

Section 1.  All men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and
indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of
acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own
happiness.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 002.0 001.0 0 PA 1969 ***

Section 2.  All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their
authority and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness.  For the advancement of these ends
they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish their
government in such manner as they may think proper.

*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 003.0 001.0 0 PA 1969 ***

Section 3.  All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to
the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect support
any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in
any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever
be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

*** SEND ***

Section 7.  The printing press shall be free to every person who may undertake to examine the
proceedings of the Legislature or any branch of government, and no law shall ever be made to
restrain the right thereof.  The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the
invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject,
being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.  No conviction shall be had in any prosecution for
the publication of papers relating to the official conduct of officers or men in public capacity, or
to any other matter proper for public investigation or information, where the fact that such
publication was not maliciously or negligently made shall be established to the satisfaction of the
jury; and in all indictments for libels the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the
facts, under the direction of the court, as in other cases.

compelled to give evidence against himself, nor can he be deprived of his life, liberty, or
property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.

(vi). Authorize local taxing authorities to exclude from taxation an amount based on the assessed
value of homestead property. The exclusions authorized by this clause shall not exceed one-half
of the median assessed value of all homestead property within a local taxing jurisdiction. A local
taxing authority may not increase the millage rate of its tax on real property to pay for these
exclusions.
