  SECTION 4.  Supreme Court. 
  
  (1) ORGANIZATION.  The supreme court shall consist of seven members, one of whom
  shall be the chief justice.  Five justices shall constitute a quorum, but the concurrence of
  four shall be necessary to a decision.
  
   (2) JURISDICTION.  Appeals from trial courts may be taken directly to the supreme
  court, as a matter of right, only from judgments imposing the death penalty, from final
  judgments or decrees directly passing upon the validity of a state statute or a federal statute
  or treaty, or construing a controlling provision of the Florida or federal constitution, and
  from final judgments or decrees in proceedings for the validation of bonds and certificates
  of indebtedness.  The supreme court may directly review by certiorari interlocutory orders
  or decrees passing upon chancery matters which upon a final decree would be directly
  appealable to the supreme court.  In all direct appeals and interlocutory reviews by
  certiorari, the supreme court shall have such jurisdiction as may be necessary to complete
  determination of the cause on review.
   Appeals from district courts of appeal may be taken to the supreme court, as a matter of
  right, only from decisions initially passing upon the validity of a state statute or a federal
  statute or treaty, or initially construing a controlling provision of the Florida or federal
  constitution.  The supreme court may review by certiorari any decision of a district court of
  appeal that affects a class of constitutional or state officers, or that passes upon a question
  certified by the district court of appeal to be of great public interest, or that is in direct
  conflict with a decision of another district court of appeal or of the supreme court on the
  same point of law, and may issue writs of certiorari to commissions established by law.
   The supreme court may issue writs of mandamus and quo warranto when a state officer,
  board, commission, or other agency authorized to represent the public generally, or a
  member of any such board, commission, or other agency, is named as respondent, and writs
  of prohibition to commissions established by law, to the district courts of appeal, and to the
  trial courts when questions are involved upon which a direct appeal to the supreme court is
  allowed as a matter of right.
   The supreme court may issue all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its
  jurisdiction.
   The supreme court or any justice thereof may issue writs of habeas corpus returnable
  before the supreme court or any justice thereof, or before a district court of appeal or any
  judge thereof, or before any circuit judge.
   The supreme court shall provide for the transfer to the court having jurisdiction of any
  matter subject to review when the jurisdiction of another appellate court has been
  improvidently invoked.
  
  (3) CHIEF JUSTICE.  The chief justice of the supreme court shall be chosen by the
  members of the court and shall serve for a term of two years.  In the event of a vacancy, a
  successor shall be chosen within sixty days for a like term.  During a vacancy or whenever
  the chief justice is unable to act for any reason, the justice longest in continuous service and
  able to act shall act as chief justice.
  
  (4) CLERK AND MARSHAL; PROCESS.  The supreme court shall appoint a clerk and a
  marshal who shall hold office during the pleasure of the court and perform such duties as
  the court directs.  Their compensation shall be fixed by law.  The marshal shall have the
  power to execute the process of the court throughout the state, and in any county may
  deputize the sheriff or a deputy sheriff for such purpose.

  SECTION 5.  District Courts of Appeal.
  
  (a) APPELLATE DISTRICTS.  The state shall be divided into three appellate districts of
  contiguous counties as the legislature may prescribe.
  
  (b)  ORGANIZATION:  NUMBER AND SELECTION OF JUDGES. A district court of
  appeal shall be organized in each appellate district.  There shall be three judges of each
  district court of appeal.  Not less than three judges shall consider each case and the
  concurrence of a majority shall be necessary to a decision.  The court shall hold at least one
  session every year in each judicial circuit within the district wherein there is ready business
  to transact.
  
  The judges of the district courts of appeal organized hereunder shall be selected as follows: 
  Between June first and July first, 1957, the governor shall appoint three persons to serve as
  judges of each district court of appeal until their successors are elected, as herein provided. 
  The judges so appointed shall take office and assume their duties on July first, 1957, and
  shall serve for a term to be designated by the governor in accordance with the following
  schedule:  The governor shall appoint one judge in each district for a term expiring on the
  first Tuesday after the first Monday in January 1959, following the election of his successor
  at the general election in November 1958, which judges shall be identified as Group "A";
  one judge in each district for a term expiring on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
  January 1961, following the election of his successor at the general election in November
  1960, which judges shall be identified as Group "B"; and one judge in each district for a
  term expiring on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January 1963, following the
  election of his successor at the general election in November 1962, which judges shall be
  identified as Group "C".
  
  The successors of the original judges of the district courts of appeal shall be elected at  the
  general election next preceding the expiration of their respective terms of office.
  
  (c) JURISDICTION.  Appeals from trial courts in each appellate district, and from final
  orders or decrees of county judge's courts pertaining to probate matters or to estates and
  interests of minors and incompetents, may be taken to the court of appeal of such district, as
  a matter of right, from all final judgments or decrees except those from which appeals may
  be taken direct to the supreme court or to a circuit court.
  
  The supreme court shall provide for expeditious and inexpensive procedure in appeals to the
  district courts of appeal, and may provide for review by such courts of interlocutory orders
  or decrees in matters reviewable by the district courts of appeal.
  
  The district courts of appeal shall have such powers of direct review of administrative
  action as may be provided by law.
  
  A district court of appeal or any judge thereof may issue writs of habeas corpus returnable
  before that district court of appeal or any judge thereof, or before any circuit judge in that
  district.  A district court of appeal may issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and
  quo warranto, and also all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its
  jurisdiction.
  
  (d)  CLERKS AND MARSHALS. Each district court of appeal shall appoint a clerk and a
  marshal who shall hold office during the pleasure of the court and perform such duties as
  the court may direct.  Their compensation shall be fixed by law.  The marshal shall have
  power to execute the process of the court throughout the state, and in any county may
  deputize the sheriff or a deputy sheriff for such purpose.

  thousand inhabitants according to the last census authorized by law, except that the county
  of Monroe shall constitute one of the circuits.
  
  (2) CIRCUIT JUDGES.  The legislature shall provide for one circuit judge in each circuit
  for each fifty thousand inhabitants or major fraction thereof according to the last census
  authorized by law.  In circuits having more than one judge the legislature may designate the
  place of residence of any such additional judge or judges.
  
  (3) JURISDICTION.  The circuit courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases
  in equity except such equity jurisdiction as may be conferred on juvenile courts, in all cases
  at law not cognizable by subordinate courts, in all cases involving the legality of any tax,
  assessment, or toll, in the action of ejectment, in all actions involving the titles or boundaries
  of real estate, and in all criminal cases not cognizable by subordinate courts.  They shall
  have original jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and unlawful detainer, and of such
  other matters as the legislature may provide. They shall have final appellate jurisdiction in all
  civil and criminal cases arising in the county court, or before county judges' courts, of all
  misdemeanors tried in criminal courts of record, and of all cases arising in municipal courts,
  small claims courts, and courts of justices of the peace.  The circuit courts and judges shall
  have power to issue writs of mandamus, injunction, quo warranto, certiorari, prohibition,
  and habeas corpus, and all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of their
  jurisdiction.
       The circuit courts and circuit judges shall have such extra-territorial jurisdiction in
  chancery cases as may be prescribed by law.
  
  (4) COURT COMMISSIONERS.  A circuit judge may appoint in each county in his circuit
  one or more one or more attorneys at law, to be court commissioners, who shall have
  power in the absence from the county of the circuit judge, to allow writs of injunction and
  to issue writs of habeas corpus, returnable before himself or the circuit judge.  Their orders
  in such matters may be reviewed by the circuit judge, and confirmed, qualified or vacated. 
  They may be removed by the circuit judge.  The legislature may confer upon them further
  powers, not judicial, and shall fix their compensation.
  
  (5) RECOMMENDATION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL; REPORT TO LEGISLATURE.
  It shall be the duty of the judges of the circuit courts to report to the attorney general at
  least thirty days before each session of the legislature such defects in the laws as may have
  been brought to their attention, and to suggest such amendments or additional legislation as
  may be deemed necessary.  The attorney general shall report to the legislature at each
  session such legislation as he may deem advisable.
  
  (6) STATE ATTORNEYS.  In each judicial circuit a state attorney shall be elected by the
  qualified electors of that circuit in the same manner as other state and county officials, to
  serve a term of four years and to fulfill duties prescribed by law.
  
  (7) CLERKS OF THE CIRCUIT COURTS.  In each county a clerk of the circuit court,
  who shall also be clerk of the board of county commissioners, recorder, and ex officio
  auditor of the county, shall be elected by the qualified electors of that county in the same
  manner as other state and county officials, to serve a term of four years and to fulfill duties
  prescribed by law.

       In any county having a population in excess of one hundred and twenty-five thousand,
  and not more than two hundred and fifty thousand, according to the last decennial federal
  census, or census authorized by the legislature and paid for by the county, the legislature
  may provide for an additional county judge for such county, provided, that any law having
  for its purpose the creating of an additional county judge in such county shall not become
  effective unless ratified by a majority of the participating voters of such county at an
  election presenting the same for approval or rejection.  In any county having a population of
  more than two hundred and fifty thousand according to such census, the legislature may,
  without referendum thereon, provide for one additional county judge for each additional
  250,000 of population or major fraction thereof.
                
  (3) JURISDICTION.  The county judge's courts shall have original jurisdiction in all cases

  SECTION 19. Institutions of higher learning and junior college capital outlay trust fund;
  bonds.
  
  (a) That beginning January 1, 1964, and for fifty years thereafter, all of the proceeds of the
  revenues derived from the gross receipts taxes collected from every person, including
  municipalities, receiving payment for electricity for light, heat or power, for natural or
  manufactured gas for light, heat or power, for use of telephones and for the sending of
  telegrams and telegraph messages, as now provided and levied as of the time of adoption of
  this amendment in Chapter 203, Florida Statutes (hereinafter called "Gross Receipts
  Taxes"), shall as collected be placed in a trust fund to be known as the "Institutions of
  Higher Learning and Junior Colleges Capital Outlay and Debt Service Trust Fund" in the
  State Treasury (hereinafter referred to as "Capital Outlay Fund"), and used only as provided
  in this Amendment.
   Said fund shall be administered by the State Board of Education, as now created and
  constituted by Section 3 of Article XII of the Constitution of Florida (hereinafter referred to
  as "State Board"). For the purpose of this Amendment, said State Board, as now
  constituted, shall continue as a body corporate during the life of this Amendment and shall
  have all the powers provided in this Amendment in addition to all other constitutional and
  statutory powers related to the purposes of this Amendment heretofore or hereafter
  conferred by law upon said State Board.
  
  (b) The State Board shall have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds for acquiring,
  building, constructing, altering, improving, enlarging, furnishing or equipping capital outlay
  projects theretofore authorized by the legislature and any purposes appurtenant or incidental
  thereto, for Institutions of Higher Learning or Junior Colleges, as now defined or as may be
  hereafter defined by law, and for the purpose of constructing buildings and other permanent
  facilities for vocational technical schools as provided in chapter 230 Florida Statutes, to
  issue bonds or certificates, including refunding bonds or certificates to fund or refund any
  bonds or certificates theretofore issued.  All such bonds or certificates shall bear interest at
  not exceeding four and one half per centum per annum, and shall mature at such time or
  times as the State Board shall determine not exceeding, in any event, however, thirty years
  from the date of issuance thereof. The State Board shall have power to determine all other
  details of such bonds or certificates and to sell at public sale, after public advertisement,
  such bonds or certificates, provided, however, that no bonds or certificates shall ever be
  issued hereunder to finance, or the proceeds thereof expended for, any part of the cost of
  any capital outlay project unless the construction or acquisition of such capital outlay
  project has been theretofore authorized by the Legislature of Florida. None of said bonds or
  certificates shall be sold at less than ninety-eight per centum of the par value thereof, plus
  accrued interest, and said bonds or certificates shall be awarded at the public sale thereof to
  the bidder offering the lowest net interest cost for such bonds or certificates in the manner
  to be determined by the State Board.
       The State Board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and
  interest on such bonds or certificates and reserves therefor, including refunding bonds or
  certificates, all or any part of the revenue to be derived from the said Gross Receipts Taxes
  provided for in this Amendment, and to enter into any covenants and other agreements with
  the holders of such bonds or certificates concerning the security thereof and the rights of the
  holders thereof, all of which covenants and agreements shall constitute legally binding and
  irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable by such holders in any
  court of competent jurisdiction.
     No such bonds or certificates shall ever be issued by the State Board in an amount
  exceeding seventy-five per centum of the amount which it determines, based upon the
  average annual amount of the revenues derived from said Gross Receipts Taxes during the
  immediately preceding two fiscal years, or the amount of the revenues derived from said
  Gross Receipts Taxes during the immediately preceding fiscal year, as shown in a certificate
  filed by the State Comptroller with the State Board prior to the issuance of such bonds or
  certificates, whichever is the lesser, can be serviced by the revenues accruing thereafter
  under the provisions of this Amendment; nor shall the State Board, during the first year
  following the ratification of this amendment, issue bonds or certificates in excess of seven
  times the anticipated revenue from said Gross Receipts Taxes during said year, nor during
  each succeeding year, more than four times the anticipated revenue from said Gross
  Receipts Taxes during such year. No election or approval of qualified electors or freeholder
  electors shall be required for the issuance of bonds or certificates hereunder.
     After the initial issuance of any bonds or certificates pursuant to this Amendment, the
  State Board may thereafter issue additional bonds or certificates which will rank equally and
  on a parity, as to lien on and source of security for payment from said Gross Receipts
  Taxes, with any bonds or certificates theretofore issued pursuant to this Amendment, but
  such additional parity bonds or certificates shall not be issued unless the average annual
  amount of the revenues derived from said Gross Re ceipts Taxes during the immediately
  preceding two fiscal years, or the amount of the revenues derived from said Gross Receipts
  Taxes during the immediately preceding fiscal year, as shown in a certificate filed by the
  State Comptroller with the State Board prior to the issuance of such bonds or certificates,
  whichever is the lesser, shall have been equal to one and one-third times the aggregate
  amount of principal and interest which will become due in any succeeding fiscal year on all
  bonds or certificates theretofore issued pursuant to this Amendment and then outstanding,
  and the additional parity bonds or certificates then proposed to be issued. No bonds,
  certificates or other obligations whatsoever shall at any time be issued under the provisions
  of this Amendment, except such bonds or certificates initially issued hereunder, and such
  additional parity bonds or certificates as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any
  other provision herein no such bonds or certificates shall be authorized or validated during
  any biennium in excess of fifty million dollars, except by two-thirds vote of the members
  elected to each house of the legislature; provided further that during the biennium 1963-
  1965 seventy-five million dollars may be authorized and validated pursuant hereto.
  
  (c) Capital outlay projects theretofore authorized by the legislature for any Institution of
  Higher Learning or Junior College shall be eligible to participate in the funds accruing under
  this Amendment derived from the proceeds of bonds or certificates and said Gross Receipts
  Taxes under such regulations and in such manner as shall be determined by the State Board,
  and the State Board shall use or transmit to the State Board of Control or to the Board of
  Public Instruction of any County authorized by law to construct or acquire such capital
  outlay projects, the amount of the proceeds of such bonds or certificates or Gross Receipts
  Taxes to be applied to or used for such capital outlay projects. If for any reason any of the
  proceeds of any bonds or certificates issued for any capital outlay project shall not be
  expended for such capital outlay project, the State Board may use such unexpended
  proceeds for any other capital outlay project for Institutions of Higher Learning or Junior
  Colleges and vocational technical schools, as defined herein, as now defined or as may be
  hereafter defined by law, theretofore authorized by the State Legislature. The holders of
  bonds or certificates issued hereunder shall not have any responsibility whatsoever for the
  application or use of any of the proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds or certificates,
  and the rights and remedies of the holders of such bonds or certificates and their right to
  payment from said Gross Receipts Taxes in the manner provided herein shall not be affected
  or impaired by the application or use of such proceeds.
    The State Board shall use the moneys in said Capital Outlay Fund in each fiscal year only
  for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:              
  (1) For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds or certificates maturing
  in such fiscal year. 
  (2) For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the proceedings authorizing the
  issuance of said bonds or certificates, of any amounts required to be deposited in such
  reserve funds in such fiscal year.                          
      (3) After all payments required in such fiscal year for the Purposes provided for in (1)
  and (2) above, including any deficiencies for required payments in prior fiscal years, any
  moneys remaining in said Capital Outlay Fund at the end of such fiscal year may be used by
  the State Board for direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of any capital outlay
  project theretofore authorized by the legislature or for the purchase of any bonds or
  certificates issued hereunder then outstanding upon such terms and conditions as the State
  Board shall deem proper, or for the prior redemption of outstanding bonds or certificates in
  accordance with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized the issuance of such
  bonds or certificates.
       The State Board may invest the moneys in said Capital Outlay Fund or in any sinking
  fund or other funds created for any issue of bonds or certificates, in direct obligations of the
  United States of America or in the other securities referred to in Section 344.27, Florida
  Statutes.
  
  (d) The State Board shall have the power to make and enforce all rules and regulations
  necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein granted and no legislation shall be
  required to render this Amendment of full force and operating effect on and after January 1,
  1964. The Legislature, during the period this Amendment is in effect, shall not reduce the
  rate of said Gross Receipts Taxes now provided in said Chapter 203, Florida Statutes, or
  eliminate, exempt or remove any of the persons, firms or corporations, including municipal
  corporations, or any of the utilities, businesses or services now or hereafter subject to said
  Gross Receipts Taxes, from the levy and collection of said Gross Receipts Taxes as now
  provided in said Chapter 203, Florida Statutes, and shall not enact any law impairing or
  materially altering the rights of the holders of any bonds or certificates issued pursuant to
  this Amendment or impairing or altering any covenants or agreements of the State Board
  made hereunder, or having the effect withdrawing the proceeds of said Gross Receipts
  Taxes from the operation of this Amendment.
  
  The State Board of Administration shall be and is hereby constituted as the Fiscal Agent of
  the State Board to perform such duties and assume such responsibilities under this
  Amendment as shall be agreed upon between the State Board and such State Board of
  Administration. The State Board shall also have power to appoint such other persons and
  fix their compensation for the administration of the provisions of this Amendment as it shall
  deem necessary, and the expenses of the State Board in administering the provisions of this
  Amendment shall be paid out of the proceeds of bonds or certificates issued hereunder or
  from said Gross Receipts Taxes deposited in said Capital Outlay Fund.
  
  (e) No capital outlay project or any part thereof shall be financed hereunder unless the bill
  authorizing such project shall specify it is financed hereunder and shall be approved by a
  vote of three-fifths of the elected members of each house.

                                                              (a) Beginning January 1, 1965 and for thirty-five years thereafter, the first proceeds of the
  revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles to the extent necessary to comply
  with the provisions of this amendment, shall, as collected, be placed monthly in the county
  capital outlay and debt service school fund in the state treasury, and used only as provided
  in this amendment.  Such revenue shall be distributed annually among the several counties in
  the ratio of the number of instruction units in each county in each year computed as
  provided herein.  The amount of the first revenues derived from the licensing of motor
  vehicles to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein shall be an amount
  equal in the aggregate to the product of four hundred dollars multiplied by the total number
  of instruction units in all the counties of Florida. The number of instruction units in each
  county in each year for the purposes of this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the
  number of instruction units in each county for the school fiscal year 1951-52 computed in
  the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the number of instruction units in
  such county for the school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter
  provided by general law and approved by the state board of education (hereinafter called the
  state board), or (3) the number of instruction units in each county on behalf of which the
  state board of education has issued bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates
  under this amendment which will produce sufficient revenues under this amendment to
  equal one and one-third times the aggregate amount of principal of and interest on such
  bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which will mature and become due in
  such year, computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and
  approved by the state board.
  Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as now created and 
  constituted by Section 3 of Article XII of the Constitution of Florida. For the purposes of
  this amendment, said state board, as now constituted, shall continue as a body corporate
  during the life of this amendment and shall have all the powers provided in this amendment
  in addition to all other constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this
  amendment heretofore or hereafter conferred upon said board.
  
  (b) The state board shall, in addition to its other constitutional and statutory powers, have
  the management, control and supervision of the proceeds of the first part of the revenues
  derived from the licensing of motor vehicles provided for in subsection (a). The state board
  shall also have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds for the use of any county board of
  public instruction in acquiring, building, constructing, altering, improving, enlarging,
  furnishing, or equipping capital outlay projects for school purposes, to issue bonds or motor
  vehicle tax anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle tax
  anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
  certificates theretofore issued by said state board. All such bonds shall bear interest at not
  exceeding four and one-half per centum per annum and shall mature serially in annual
  installments commencing not more than three years from the date of issuance thereof and
  ending not later than thirty years from the date of issuance or January 1, 2000, A.D.,
  whichever is earlier. All such motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall bear interest at
  not exceeding four and one-half per centum per annum and shall mature prior to January 1,
  2000, A.D. The state board shall have power to determine all other details of said bonds or
  motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates and to sell at public sale after public
  advertisement, or exchange said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, upon
  such terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.
   The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and
  interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, including refunding
  bonds or refunding motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, all or any part from the
  anticipated revenues to be derived from the licensing of motor vehicles provided for in this
  amendment and to enter into any covenants and other agreements with the holders of such
  bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates at the time of the issuance thereof
  concerning the security thereof and the rights of the holders thereof, all of which covenants
  and agreements shall constitute legally binding and irrevocable contracts with such holders
  and shall be fully enforceable by such holders in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   No such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall ever be issued by the
  state board until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the issuance thereof by the
  county board of public instruction of the county on behalf of which such obligations are to
  be issued. The state board of education shall limit the amount of such bonds or motor
  vehicle tax anticipation certificates which can be issued on behalf of any county to seventy-
  five percent of the amount which it determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to
  the county under the provisions of this amendment, and such determination shall be
  conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall be issued in
  the name of the state board of education but shall be issued for and on behalf of the county
  board of public instruction requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of
  qualified electors or freeholders shall be required for the issuance thereof.
  
  (c) The State Board shall in each year use the funds distributable pursuant to this
  Amendment to the credit of each county only in the following manner and order of priority: 
  
  (1) To pay all amounts of principal and interest maturing in such year on any bonds or
  motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued under the authority hereof, including
  refunding bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, issued on behalf of the Board
  of Public Instruction of such county; subject, however, to any covenants or agreements
  made by the State Board concerning the rights between holders of different issues of such
  bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, as herein authorized.
  
  (2) To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future requirements for debt
  service, or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued
  on behalf of the Board of Public Instruction of such county, under the authority hereof,
  whenever the State Board shall deem it necessary or advisable, and in such amounts and
  under such terms and conditions as the State Board shall in its discretion determine.
  
  (3) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction of the counties for               
  use in payment of debt service on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by any such Board
  where the proceeds of the bonds were used, or are to be used, in the construction,
  acquisition, improvement, enlargement, furnishing, or equipping of capital outlay projects in
  such county, and which capital outlay projects have been approved by the Board of Public
  Instruction of the county, pursuant to a survey or surveys conducted subsequent to July 1,
  1947 in the county, under regulations prescribed by the State Board to determine the capital
  outlay needs of the county. 
    The State Board shall have power at the time of issuance of any bonds by any Board of
  Public Instruction to covenant and agree with such Board as to the rank and priority of
  payments to be made for different issues of bonds under this Subsection (3), and may
  further agree that any amounts to be distributed under this Subsection (3) may be pledged
  for the debt service on bonds issued by any Board of Public Instruction and for the rank and
  priority of such pledge. Any such covenants or agreements of the State Board may be
  enforced by any holders of such bonds in any court of competent jurisdiction.
  
  (4) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction of the counties for the
  payment of the cost of the construction, acquisition, improvement, enlargement, furnishing,
  or equipping of capital outlay projects for school purposes in such county as shall be
  requested by resolution of the County Board of Public Instruction of such county. 
  
  (5) When all major capital outlay needs of a county have been met as determined by the
  State Board, on the basis of a survey made pursuant to regulations of the State Board and
  approved by the State Board, all such funds remaining be distributed annually and used for
  such school purposes in such county as the Board of Public Instruction of the county shall
  determine, or as may be provided by general law.            
  
  (d) Capital outlay projects of a county shall be eligible to participate in the funds accruing
  under this Amendment and derived from the proceeds of bonds and motor vehicle tax
  anticipation certificates and from the motor vehicle license taxes, only in the order of
  priority of  needs, as shown by a survey or surveys conducted in the county under
  regulations  prescribed by the State Board, to determine the capital outlay needs of the
  county and approved by the State Board; provided, that the priority of such projects may be
  changed from time to time upon the request of the Board of Public Instruction of the county
  and with the approval of the State Board; and provided further, that this Subsection (d)
  shall not in any manner affect any covenant, agreement, or pledge made by the State Board
  in the issuance by said State Board of any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
  certificates, or in connection with the issuance of any bonds of any Board of Public
  Instruction of any county. 
  
  (e) The State Board may invest any sinking fund or funds created pursuant to this
  Amendment in direct obligations of the United States of America or in the bonds or motor
  vehicle tax anticipation certificates, matured or to mature issued by the State Board on
  behalf of the Board of Public Instruction of any county. 
  
  (f) The State Board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and regulations
  necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein granted and no legislation shall be
  required to render this Amendment of full force and operating effect from and after January
  1, 1953. The Legislature shall not reduce the levies of said motor vehicle license taxes
  during the life of this Amendment to any degree which will fail to provide the full amount
  necessary to comply with the provisions of this Amendment and pay the necessary expenses
  of administering the laws relating to the licensing of motor vehicles, and shall not enact any
  law having the effect of with drawing the proceeds of such motor vehicle license taxes from
  the operation of this Amendment and shall not enact any law impairing or materially altering
  the rights of the holders of any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued
  pursuant to this Amendment or impairing or altering any covenant or agreement of the State

  SECTION 17A.  Discipline, retirement and removal of justices and certain judges.
  (1)  Except as it provides for mandatory retirement, this section shall apply to every justice
  of the supreme court and judge of the district courts of appeal and circuit courts.  It shall be
  the sole method of disciplining, automatically or involuntarily retiring or removing such
  justices or judges, provided that all such justices or judges shall be liable to impeachment for
  any misdemeanor in office.  All justices and judges shall automatically retire at age seventy
  except those who held any judicial office on July 1, 1957; provided, however, that such
  mandatory retirement shall not prohibit a justice or judge from serving the entire term to
  which he was appointed or elected if he attains his 70th birthday after serving at least one-
  half of such term.
  
  (2)  There shall be a judicial qualifications commission composed of:
       (a) Two judges of the district courts of appeal appointed by the judges of those
       courts and two circuit court judges appointed by the judges of those courts.
       
       (b)  Two members of the Florida bar, who shall have practiced law in this state for
       at least eight years, appointed by the board of governors of the Florida bar; and 
       
       (c) Three citizens, each of whom shall have been a resident of this state for at least
       five years, neither of whom shall be a justice or judge of any court, active or retired,
       nor a member of the Florida bar, appointed by the governor.  When a member
       appointed under paragraph (a) ceases to be a judge of the court from which he was
       appointed or a member appointed under paragraph (b) ceases to be a member of the
       Florida bar, or a member appointed under paragraph (c) becomes a justice or judge
       of any court or a member of the Florida bar, his membership on the commission
       shall terminate and a successor shall be appointed for the remainder of his term.  No
       member of the commission appointed under paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be eligible
       to succeed himself.  Except as provided herein, no member of the commission shall
       hold a public office and no member shall hold office in a political party.  The
       compensation and terms of office of members of the commission shall be fixed by
       law, provided that not more than one third of the terms of the members shall
       terminate in any two year period.  No recommendation of the commission to the
       supreme court shall be valid unless concurred in by two thirds of its members.  The
       commission shall elect one of its members to serve as chairman.
  
  (3)  Any justice or judge to whom this section applies may be disciplined by private
  reprimand or removed from office for willful or persistent failure to perform his duties or
  habitual intemperance or conduct unbecoming a member of the judiciary or he may be
  involuntarily retired for disability seriously interfering with the performance of his duties,
  which is, or is likely to become, permanent in nature.  After such investigation as it deems
  necessary, the judicial qualifications commission may conduct a hearing concerning the
  removal, discipline or retirement of a justice or judge or request the supreme court to
  appoint three special referees, who shall be active or retired justices or judges of courts of
  record, to hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report thereon to the
  commission.  All hearings shall be held in the county in which the justice or judge involved
  resides.  Testimony shall be under oath, administered by a member of the commission or a
  special referee, and subject to the penalties for perjury.  If after hearing, or after considering
  the record and report of the referees, the commission finds good cause therefor, it shall
  recommend to the supreme court the removal, discipline or retirement of the justice or
  judge.  The supreme court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts
  and shall order removal, discipline or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject
  the commission's recommendation.  Upon an order for involuntary retirement for disability,
  the justice or judge shall thereby be retired at retirement pay to be fixed by law which as to
  a justice of the supreme court, judge of a district court of appeal or circuit judge shall not be
  less than two thirds of his then compensation if he has served for ten years or more as
  justice or judge of such court or courts.  Upon an order for removal, the justice or judge
  shall thereby be removed from office, and his salary shall cease from the date of such order. 
  The supreme court shall make rules providing for the procedure before the commission and
  the referees and the extent to which communications shall be privileged or confidential,
  provided that upon the entry of an order of discipline, removal or retirement the record shall
  no longer remain confidential.  A justice or judge shall be disqualified in any proceeding
  involving his own discipline, retirement or removal.  The supreme court shall by rule
  provide for the disqualification of any member of the commission or referee and for the ad
  hoc appointment of a person to take the place of a disqualified person.
  
  (4)  In the event a judge is removed from office, his judicial service shall not provide
  immunity from disciplinary proceedings for professional misconduct performed during his
  term of office or prior thereto.
