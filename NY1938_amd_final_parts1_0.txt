exceeding in the aggregate three hundred million dollars, to provide moneys for the elimination,
under state supervision, of railroad crossings at grade within the state, and for incidental
improvements connected therewith as authorized by this section. The provisions of this article,
not inconsistent with this section, relating to the issuance of bonds for a debt or debts of the state
and the maturity and payment thereof, shall apply to a state debt or debts created pursuant to this
section; except that the law authorizing the contracting of such debt or debts shall take effect
without submission to the people pursuant to section 11 of this article.  The aggregate amount of
a state debt or debts which may be created pursuant to this section shall not exceed the difference
between the amount of the debt or debts heretofore created or authorized by law, under the
provisions of section 14 of article VII of the constitution in force on July first, nineteen hundred
thirty-eight, and the sum of three hundred million dollars.
The expense of any grade crossing elimination the construction work for which was not
commenced before January first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine, including incidental
improvements connected therewith as authorized by this section, whether or not an order for such
elimination shall theretofore have been made, shall be paid by the state in the first instance, but
the state shall be entitled to recover from the railroad company or companies, by way of
reimbursement (1) the entire amount of the railroad improvements not an essential part of
elimination, and (2) the amount of the net benefit to the company or companies from the
elimination exclusive of such railroad improvements, the amount of such net benefit to be
adjudicated after the completion of the work in the manner to be prescribed by law, and in no
event to exceed fifteen per centum of the expense of the elimination, exclusive of all incidental
improvements. The reimbursement by the railroad companies shall be payable at such times, in
such manner and with interest at such rate as the legislature may prescribe.
     The expense of any grade crossing elimination the construction work for which was
commenced before January first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine, shall be borne by the state,
railroad companies, and the municipality or  municipalities in the proportions formerly
prescribed by section 14 of article VII of the constitution in force on July first, nineteen hundred
thirty-eight, and the law or laws enacted pursuant to its provisions, applicable to such
elimination, and subject to the provisions of such former section and law or laws including
advances in aid of any railroad company or municipality, although such elimination shall not be
completed until after January first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine.
A grade crossing elimination the construction work for which shall be commenced after
January first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine, shall include incidental improvements rendered
necessary or desirable because of such elimination, and reasonably included in the engineering
plans therefor.
Out of the balance of all moneys authorized to b expended under section 14 of article VII of
the constitution in force on July first, nineteen hundred thirty-eight and remaining unexpended
and unobligated on such date fifty million dollars shall be deemed segregated for grade crossing
eliminations and incidental improvements in the city of New York and shall be available only for
such purposes until such eliminations and improvements are completed and paid for.      
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions this section the legislature is hereby authorized
to appropriate, out of the proceeds of bonds now or hereafter sold to provide moneys for the
elimination of railroad crossings at grade and incidental improvements pursuant to this section,
sums not exceeding in the aggregate sixty million dollars for the construction and reconstruction
of state highways and parkways.

1. Any amendment or amendments to this constitution may be proposed in the senate and
assembly, whereupon such amendment or amendments shall be referred to the attorney-general
whose duty it shall be within twenty days thereafter to render an opinion in writing to the senate
and assembly as to the effect of such amendment or amendments upon other provisions of the
constitution. Upon receiving such opinion, if the amendment or amendments as proposed or as

taken thereon, and referred to the next regular legislative session convening after the succeeding
general election of members of the assembly, and shall be published for three months previous to
the time of making such choice; and if in such legislative session, such proposed amendment or
amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each house, then it
shall be the duty of the legislature to submit each proposed amendment or amendments to the
people for approval in such manner and at such times as the legislature shall prescribe; and if the
people shall approve and ratify such amendment or amendments by a majority of the electors
voting thereon, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of the constitution on the
first day of January next after such approval. Neither the failure of the attorney-general to render
an opinion concerning such a proposed amendment nor his failure to do so timely shall affect the
validity of such proposed amendment or legislative action thereon.

no event an amount the difference between such revenue and such norm, shall be paid from such
fund into the general fund.

Art. 6, Sec. 7.
7. The jurisdiction. of the court of appeals shall be limited to the review of questions of law
except where the judgment is of death, or where the appellate division, on reversing or modifying
a final or interlocutory judgment in an action or a final or interlocutory order in a special
proceeding, finds new facts and a final judgment or a final order pursuant thereto is entered; but
the right to appeal shall not depend upon the amount involved.  Appeals to the court of appeals
may be taken in the classes of cases hereafter enumerated in this section:
    In criminal cases, directly from a court of original jurisdiction where the judgment is of death,
and in other criminal cases from an appellate division or otherwise as the legislature may from
time to time provide.
  In civil cases and proceedings as follows:
(1) As of right, from a judgment or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division of
the supreme court which finally determines an action or special proceeding wherein is directly
involved the construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States, or where one or
more of the justices of the appellate division dissents from the decision of the court, or where the
judgment or order is one of reversal or modification.
(2) As of right, from a judgment or order of a court of record of original jurisdiction which
finally determines an action or special proceeding where the only question involved on the appeal
is the validity of a statutory provision of the state or of the United States under the constitution of
the state or of the United States; and on any such appeal only the constitutional question shall be
considered and determined by the court.
(3) As of right, from an order of the appellate division granting a new trial in an action or a
new hearing in a special proceeding where the appellant stipulates that, upon affirmance,
judgment absolute or final order shall be rendered against him.
 (4) From a determination of the appellate division of the supreme court in any department,
other than a judgment or order which finally determines an action or special proceeding, where
the appellate division allows the same and certifies that one or more questions of law have arisen
which, in its opinion, ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals, but in such case the appeal
shall bring up for review only the question or questions so certified; and the court of appeals shall
certify to the appellate division its determination upon such question or questions.
(5) From a judgment or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division of the
supreme court which finally determines an action or special proceeding but which is not
appealable under subdivision (1) of this section where the appellate division or the court of
appeals shall certify that in its opinion a question of law is involved which ought to be reviewed
by the court of appeals. Such an appeal may be allowed upon application (a) to the appellate
division, and in case of refusal, to the court of appeals, or (b) directly to the court of appeals.
Such an appeal shall be allowed when required in the interest of substantial justice.
(6) No appeal shall be taken to the court of appeals from a judgment or order entered upon the
decision of an appellate division of the supreme court in any civil case or proceeding originally
commenced in any court other than the supreme court, a county court, a surrogate's court, or the
court of claims unless the construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States is
directly involved therein, or unless the appellate division of the supreme court shall certify that in
its opinion a question of law is involved which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals.        
(7) The legislature may abolish an appeal to the court of appeals as of right in any or all of the
cases or classes of cases specified. in subdivision (1) of this section wherein no question
involving the construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States is directly
involved, provided, however, that appeals in any such case or class of cases shall thereupon be
governed by subdivision (5) of this section.

such temporary president shall perform all the duties of lieutenant-governor, including the duty
of acting as governor when necessary, during such vacancy, inability, absence or the pendency of

Art. 3, Sec. 4.
4. Except as herein otherwise provided, the federal census taken in the year nineteen hundred
thirty and each federal census taken decennially thereafter shall be controlling as to the number
of inhabitants in the state or any part thereof for the purposes of the apportionment of members
of assembly and readjustment or alteration of senate and assembly districts next occurring, in so
far as such census and the tabulation thereof purport to give the information necessary therefor.
The legislature, by law, shall provide for the making and tabulation by state authorities of an
enumeration of the inhabitants of the entire state to be used for such purposes, instead of a
federal census, if the taking of a federal census in any tenth year from the year nineteen hundred
thirty be omitted or if the federal census fails to show the number of aliens or Indians not taxed.
If a federal census, though giving the requisite information as to the state at large, fails to give the
information as to any civil or territorial divisions which is required to be known for such
purposes, the legislature, by law, shall provide for such an enumeration of the inhabitants of such
parts of the state only as may be necessary, which shall supersede in part the federal census and
be used in connection therewith for such purposes. The legislature, by law, may provide in its
discretion for an enumeration by state authorities of the inhabitants of the state, to be used for
such purposes, in place of a federal census, when the return of a decennial federal census is
delayed so that it is not available at the beginning of the regular session of the legislature in the
second year after the year nineteen hundred thirty or after any tenth year therefrom, or if an
apportionment of members of assembly and readjustment or alteration of senate districts is not
made at or before such a session. At the regular session in the year nineteen hundred thirty-two,
and at the first regular session after the year nineteen hundred forty and after each tenth year
therefrom the senate districts shall be readjusted or altered, but if, in any decade, counting from
and including that which begins with the year nineteen hundred thirty-one, such a readjustment or
alteration is not made at the time above prescribed, it shall be made at a subsequent session
occurring not later than the sixth year of such decade, meaning not later than nineteen hundred
thirty-six, nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred fifty-six, and so on; provided, however,
that if such districts shall have been readjusted or altered by law in either of the years nineteen
hundred thirty or nineteen hundred thirty-one, they shall remain unaltered until the first regular
session after the year nineteen hundred forty. Such districts shall be so readjusted or altered that
each senate district shall contain as nearly as may be an equal number of inhabitants, excluding
aliens, and be in as compact form as practicable, and shall remain unaltered until the first year of
the next decade as above defined, and shall at all times consist of contiguous territory, and no
county shall be divided in the formation of a senate district except to make two or more senate
districts wholly in such county. No town, except a town having more than a full ratio of
apportionment, and no block in a city inclosed by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the
formation of senate districts; nor shall any district contain a greater excess in population over an
adjoining district in the same county, than the population of a town or block therein adjoining
such district. Counties, towns or blocks which, from their location, may be included in either of
two districts, shall be so placed as to make said districts most nearly equal in number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens.
     No county shall have four or more senators unless it shall have a full ratio for each senator.
No county  shall have more than one-third of all the senators; and no two counties or the territory
thereof as now organized, which are adjoining counties, or which are separated only by public
waters, shall have more than one-half of all the senators.
     The ratio for apportioning senators shall always be obtained by dividing the number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens, by fifty, and the senate shall always be composed of fifty members,
except that if any county having three or more senators at the time of any apportionment shall be
entitled on such ratio to an additional senator or senators, such additional senator or senators
shall be given to such county in addition to the fifty senators, and the whole number of senators
shall be increased to that extent.
     The senate districts, including the present ones as existing immediately before the
enactment of a law readjusting or altering the senate districts, shall continue to be the senate
districts of the state until the expirations of the terms of the senators then in office, except for the
purpose of an election of senators for full terms beginning at such expirations, and for the
formation of assembly districts.

Art. 3, Sec. 5.
5.  The members of the assembly shall be chosen by single districts and shall be apportioned
by the legislature at each regular session at which the senate districts are readjusted or altered,
and by the same law, among the several counties of the state, as nearly as may be according to the
number of their respective inhabitants, excluding aliens. Every county heretofore established and
separately organized, except the county of Hamilton, shall always be entitled to one member of
assembly, and no county shall hereafter be erected unless its population shall entitle it to a
member. The county of Hamilton shall elect with the county of Fulton, until the population of the
county of Hamilton shall according to the ratio, entitle it to a member. But the legislature may
abolish the said county of Hamilton and annex the territory thereof to some other county or
counties,
The quotient obtained by dividing the whole number of inhabitants of the state, excluding
aliens, by the number of members of assembly, shall be the ratio for apportionment, which shall
be made as follows: One member of assembly shall be apportioned. to every county, including
Fulton and Hamilton as one county, containing less than the ratio and one-half over. Two
members shall be apportioned to every other county. The remaining members of assembly shall
be apportioned to the counties having more than two ratios according to the number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens. Members apportioned on remainders shall be apportioned to the
counties having the highest remainders in the order thereof respectively. No county shall have
more members of assembly than a county having a greater number of inhabitants, excluding
aliens.
The assembly districts, including the present ones, as existing immediately before the enactment
of a law making an apportionment of members of assembly among the counties, shall continue to
be the assembly districts of the state until the expiration of the terms of members then in office,
except for the purpose of an election of members of assembly for full terms beginning at such
expirations.
     In any county entitled to more than one member, the board of supervisors, and in any city
embracing an entire county and having no board of supervisors, the common council, or if there
be none, the body exercising the powers of a common council, shall assemble at such times as
the legislature making an apportionment shall prescribe, and divide such counties into assembly
districts as nearly equal in number of inhabitants, excluding aliens, as may be, of convenient and
contiguous territory in as compact form as practicable, each of which shall be wholly within a
senate district formed under the same apportionment, equal to the number of members of
assembly to which such county shall be entitled, and shall cause to be filed in the office of the
secretary of state and of the clerk of such county, a description of such districts, specifying the
number of each district and of the inhabitants thereof, excluding aliens, according to the census
or enumeration used as the population basis for the formation of such districts; and such
apportionment and districts shall remain unaltered until after the next reapportionment of
members of assembly, except that the board of supervisors of any county containing a town
having more than a ratio of apportionment and one-half over may alter the assembly districts in a
senate district containing such town at any time on or before March first, nineteen hundred forty-
six. In counties having more than one senate district, the same number of assembly districts shall
be put in each senate district, unless the assembly districts cannot be evenly divided among the
senate districts of any county, in which case one more assembly district shall be put in the senate
district in such county having the largest, or one less assembly district shall be put in the senate
district in such county having the smallest number of inhabitants, excluding aliens, as the case
may require. No town, except a town having more than a ratio of apportionment and one-half
over, and no block in a city inclosed by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the formation
of assembly districts, nor shall any districts contain a greater excess in population over an
adjoining district in the same senate district, than the population of a town or block therein
adjoining such assembly district. Towns or blocks which, from their location may be included in
either of two districts, shall be so placed as to make said districts most nearly equal in number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens. Nothing in this section shall prevent the division, at any time, of
counties and towns and the erection of new towns by the legislature.
     An apportionment by the legislature, or other body, shall be subject to review by the supreme
court, at the suit of any citizen, under such reasonable regulations as the legislature may
prescribe; and any court before which a cause may be pending involving an apportionment, shall
give precedence thereto over all other causes and proceedings, and if said court be not in session
it shall convene promptly for the disposition of the same.
