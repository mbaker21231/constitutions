Third. In order that payment of the debts and liabilities contracted or incurred by and on behalf of

for the division of Dakota into two states and to enable the people of North Dakota, South
Dakota, Montana and Washington to form constitutions and state governments and to be

 The words "State of North Dakota," wherever used in this agreement, shall be taken to mean
the Territory of North Dakota in case the State of South Dakota shall be admitted into the union
prior to the admission into the union of the State of North Dakota; and the words "State of South
Dakota," wherever used in this agreement, shall be taken to mean the Territory of South Dakota
in case the State of North Dakota shall be admitted into the union prior to the admission into the
union of the State of South Dakota.
The said State of North Dakota shall assume and pay all bonds issued by the Territory of Dakota 
to provide funds for the purchase, constitution, repairs or maintenance of such public institutions,
grounds or buildings as are located within the boundaries of North Dakota, and shall pay all
warrants issued under and by virtue of that certain act of the legislative assembly of the Territory
of Dakota, approved March 8, 1889, entitled "An act to provide for the refunding of outstanding
warrants drawn on the capitol building fund."                              
 The State of South Dakota shall assume and pay all bonds issued by the Territory of Dakota to

grounds or buildings as are located within the boundaries of South Dakota, that is to say, the
State of North Dakota shall assume and pay the following bonds and indebtedness, to wit:

 Bonds issued on account of the hospital for insane at Jamestown, North Dakota, the face
aggregate of which is $266,000; also, bonds issued on account of the North Dakota university at

    The states of North Dakota and South Dakota shall pay one-half each of all liabilities now
existing or hereafter and prior to the taking effect of this agreement incurred, except those
heretofore or hereafter incurred, on account of public institutions, grounds or buildings, except as
otherwise herein specifically provided.
     The state of South Dakota shall pay to the State of North Dakota $46,500, on account of the
excess of territorial appropriations for the permanent improvement of territorial institutions
which under this agreement will go to South Dakota, and in full of the undivided one-half
interest of North Dakota in the territorial library, and in full settlement of unbalanced accounts,
and of all claims against the territory, of whatever nature, legal or equitable, arising out of the
alleged erroneous or unlawful taxation of Northern Pacific railroad lands, and the payment of
said amount shall discharge and exempt the State of South Dakota from all liability for or on
account of the several matters hereinbefore referred to; nor shall either state be called upon to pay
or answer to any portion of liability hereafter arising or accruing on account of transactions
heretofore had, which liability would be a liability of the Territory of Dakota had such territory
remained in existence, and which liability shall grow out of matters connected with any public
institutions, grounds or buildings of the territory situated or located within the boundaries of the
other state.
     A final adjustment of accounts shall be made upon the following basis: North Dakota shall be
charged with all sums paid on account of the public institutions, grounds or buildings located
within its boundaries on account of the current appropriations since March 9, 1889; and South
Dakota shall be charged with all sums paid on account of public institutions, grounds or
buildings located within its boundaries on the same account and during the same time. Each state
shall be charged with one-half of all other expenses of the territorial government during the same
time. All moneys paid into the treasury during the period from March 8, 1889, to the time of
taking effect of this agreement by any county, municipality or person within the limits of the
proposed State of North Dakota, shall be credited to the State of North Dakota; and all sums paid
into said treasury within the same time by any county, municipality or person within the limits of
the proposed State of South Dakota shall be credited to the State of South Dakota; except that
any and all taxes on gross earnings paid into said treasury by railroad corporations, since the 8th
day of March, 1889, based upon earnings of years prior to 1888, under and by virtue of the act of
the legislative assembly of the Territory of Dakota, approved March 7, 1889, and entitled "An act
providing for the levy and collection of taxes upon property of railroad companies in this
Territory," being chapter 107 of the session laws of 1889 (that is, the part of such sums going to
the territory), shall be equally divided between the states of North Dakota and South Dakota, and
all taxes heretofore or hereafter paid into said treasury under and by virtue of the act last
mentioned, based on the gross earning of the year 1888, shall be distributed as already provided
by laws except that so much thereof as goes to the territorial treasury shall be divided as follows:
North Dakota shall have so much thereof as shall be or has been paid by railroads within the
limits of the proposed State of North Dakota, and South Dakota so much thereof as shall be or
has been paid by railroads within the limits of the proposed State of South Dakota; each state
shall be credited also with all balances of appropriations made by the seventeenth legislative
assembly of the Territory of Dakota for the account of the public institutions, grounds or
buildings situated within its limits, remaining unexpended on March 8, 1889. If there shall be any
indebtedness except the indebtedness represented by the bonds and refunding warrants
hereinbefore mentioned, each state shall at the time of such final adjustment of accounts, assume
its share of said indebtedness as determined by the amount paid on account of the public
institutions, grounds or buildings of such state in excess of the receipts from counties,
municipalities, railroad corporations or persons within the limits of said state, as provided in this
article; and if there should be a surplus at the time of such final adjustment, each state shall be
entitled to the amounts received from counties, municipalities, railroad corporations or persons
within its limits over and above the amount charged it. And the State of North Dakota hereby
obligates itself to pay such part of the debts and liabilities of the Territory of Dakota as is
declared by the foregoing agreement to be its proportion thereof, the same as if such proportion
had been originally created by said State of North Dakota as its own debt or liability.

SEC. 25. The legislative authority of the state of North Dakota shall be vested in a legislative
assembly consisting of a senate and a house of representatives, but the people reserve to
themselves the power, first, to propose laws and to enact and reject the same at the polls,
independent of the legislative assembly, and also reserve power, at their own option, to approve
or reject at the polls any act, item, section, or part of any act or measure passed by the legislative
assembly.
 The first power reserved by the people is the initiative, or the power to propose measures for
enactment into laws, and at least ten percent of the legal voters to be secured in a majority of the
counties of this state shall be required to propose any measure by initiative petition, and every
such petition shall contain the full text of the measure so proposed.  Initiative petitions shall be
filed with the Secretary of State not less than thirty days before any regular session of the
legislative assembly; he shall transmit the same to the legislative assembly as soon as it
convenes.  Such initiative measure shall take precedence over all other measure in the legislative
assembly except appropriation bills, and shall be either enacted or rejected without change or
amendment by the legislative assembly within forty days.  If any such initiative measure shall be
enacted by the legislative assembly it shall be subject to referendum petition, or it may be
referred by the legislative assembly to the people for approval or rejection.  If it is rejected or no
action is taken upon it by the legislative assembly within said forty days, the Secretary of State
shall submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. 
The legislative assembly may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a
different one to accomplish the same purpose, and in any such event both measures shall be
submitted by the Secretary of State to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing
regular election.  If conflicting measures submitted to the people at the next ensuing election
shall be approved by a majority of the votes severally cast for and against the same, the one
receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall thereby become valid and the other shall
thereby be rejected.
 The second power is the referendum, or the power to order any act, item, or part of any act to
be referred to the people for their approval or rejection at the polls, and it may be ordered (except
as to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety), as to
any measure or any parts, items or sections of any measures passed by the legislative assembly
either by a petition signed by ten percent of the legal voters of the state from a majority of the
counties or by the legislative assembly, if a majority of the members-elect vote therefor.  When it
is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety that a law shall
become effective without delay, such necessity and the facts creating the same shall be state in
one section of the bill, and if upon aye and nay vote in each house two-thirds of all members
elected to each house shall vote on a separate roll call in favor of the said law going into instant
operation for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, such law shall
become operative upon approval by the Governor.
The filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of an act
shall not delay the remainder of that act from become operative.  Referendum petitions against
measures passed by the legislative assembly shall be filed with the Secretary of State not more
than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislative assembly which
passed the measure on which  the referendum is demanded.  The veto power of the Governor
shall not extend to measures referred to the people.  All elections on measures referred to the
people of the state shall be had at biennial regular elections, except as provisions may be made by
law for a special election or elections.  Any measure referred to the people shall take effect when
it is approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and not otherwise and shall be in force from
the date of the official declaration of the vote.  
 The enacting clause of all initiative bills shall be:  "Be it enacted by the people of the State of
North Dakota."  This Section shall not be construed  to deprive any member of the legislative
assembly of the right to introduce any measure.  The whole number of votes cast for Secretary of
State at the regular election last preceding the filing of any petition for the initiative or for the
referendum shall be the basis on which the number of legal voters necessary to sign such petition
shall be counted. 
 Petitions and orders for the initiative and for the referendum shall be filed with the Secretary of
State, and in submitting the same to the people he and all other officers shall be guided by the
general laws and the acts submitting this amendment until legislation shall be especially provided
therefor.
 This amendment shall be self executing, but legislation may be enacted to facilitate its
operation.

SEC. 25. The legislative power of this state shall be vested in a legislature consisting of a senate

measures and to enact or reject the same at the polls; second, to approve or reject at the polls any
measure or any item, section, part or parts of any measure enacted by the legislature.
 The first power reserved is the initiative.  Ten thousand electors at large may propose any
measure by initiative petition.  Every such petition shall contain the full text of the measure and
shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than ninety days before the election at which it
is to be voted upon.
 The second power reserved is the referendum.  Seven thousand electors at large may, by
referendum petition, suspend the operation of any measure enacted by the legislature, except an
emergency measure.  But the filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections
or parts of any measure, shall not prevent the remainder from going into effect.  Such petition
shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the adjournment of the
session of the legislature at which such measure was enacted.
 Each measure initiated by or referred to the electors, shall be submitted by its ballot title, which
shall be placed upon the ballot by the Secretary of State and shall be voted upon at any state-wide
election designated in the petition, or at a special election called by the Governor. The result of
the vote upon any measure shall be canvassed and declared by the board of canvassers.
 Any measure, except an emergency measure, submitted to the electors of the state, shall
become a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon.  And such law shall go into
effect on the 30th day after the election, unless otherwise specified in the measure.
 In a referendum petition is filed against an emergency measure such measure shall be a law
until voted upon by the electors.  And if it is then rejected by a majority of the votes cast thereon
it shall be thereby repealed.  Any such measure shall be submitted to the electors at a special
election if so ordered by the Governor, or if the referendum petition filed against it shall be
signed by thirty thousand electors at large.  Such special election shall be called by the Governor,
and shall be held not less than one hundred nor more than one hundred thirty days after the
adjournment of the session of the legislature.
 The Secretary of State shall pass upon each petition, and if he finds it insufficient, he shall
notify the "Committee for the Petitioners" and allow twenty days for correction or amendment. 
All decisions of the Secretary of State in regard to any such petition shall be subject to review by
the supreme court.  But if the sufficiency of such petition is being reviewed at the time the ballot
is prepared, the Secretary of State shall place the measure on the ballot and no subsequent

SEC. 25. The legislative power of this state shall be vested in a legislature consisting of a senate
and a house of representatives.  The people, however, reserve the power, first, to propose
measures and to enact or reject the same at the polls; second, to approve or reject at the polls any
measure or any item, section, part or parts of any measure enacted by the legislature.
 The first power reserved is the initiative.  Ten thousand electors at large may propose any
measure by initiative petition.  Every such petition shall contain the full text of the measure and
shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than ninety days before the election at which it
is to be voted upon.
 The second power reserved is the referendum.  Seven thousand electors at large may, by
referendum petition, suspend the operation of any measure enacted by the legislature, except an
emergency measure.  But the filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections
or parts of any measure, shall not prevent the remainder from going into effect.  Such petition
shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the adjournment of the
session of the legislature at which such measure was enacted.
 Each measure initiated by or referred to the electors, shall be submitted by its ballot title, which
shall be placed upon the ballot by the Secretary of State and shall be voted upon at any state-wide
election designated in the petition, or at a special election called by the Governor. The result of
the vote upon any measure shall be canvassed and declared by the board of canvassers.
 Any measure, except an emergency measure, submitted to the electors of the state, shall
become a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon.  And such law shall go into
effect on the 30th day after the election, unless otherwise specified in the measure.
 In a referendum petition is filed against an emergency measure such measure shall be a law
until voted upon by the electors.  And if it is then rejected by a majority of the votes cast thereon
it shall be thereby repealed.  Any such measure shall be submitted to the electors at a special
election if so ordered by the Governor, or if the referendum petition filed against it shall be
signed by thirty thousand electors at large.  Such special election shall be called by the Governor,
and shall be held not less than one hundred nor more than one hundred thirty days after the
adjournment of the session of the legislature.
 The Secretary of State shall pass upon each petition, and if he finds it insufficient, he shall
notify the "Committee for the Petitioners" and allow twenty days for correction or amendment. 
All decisions of the Secretary of State in regard to any such petition shall be subject to review by
the supreme court.  But if the sufficiency of such petition is being reviewed at the time the ballot
is prepared, the Secretary of State shall place the measure on the ballot and no subsequent
decision shall invalidate such measure if it is at such election approved by a majority of the votes
cast thereon.  If proceedings are brought against any petition upon any ground, the burden of
proof shall be upon the party attacking it. No law shall be enacted limiting the number of copies
of a petition which may be circulated.  Such copies shall become a part of the original petition
when filed or attached thereto.  Nor shall any law be enacted prohibiting any person from giving

proposed State of North Dakota, shall be credited to the State of North Dakota; and all sums paid

any and all taxes on gross earnings paid into said treasury by railroad corporations, since the 8th
day of March, 1889, based upon earnings of years prior to 1888, under and by virtue of the act of
the legislative assembly of the Territory of Dakota, approved March 7, 1889, and entitled "An act
providing for the levy and collection of taxes upon property of railroad companies in this
Territory," being chapter 107 of the session laws of 1889 (that is, the part of such sums going to
the territory), shall be equally divided between the states of North Dakota and South Dakota, and
all taxes heretofore or hereafter paid into said treasury under and by virtue of the act last
mentioned, based on the gross earning of the year 1888, shall be distributed as already provided
by laws except that so much thereof as goes to the territorial treasury shall be divided as follows:
North Dakota shall have so much thereof as shall be or has been paid by railroads within the
limits of the proposed State of North Dakota, and South Dakota so much thereof as shall be or
has been paid by railroads within the limits of the proposed State of South Dakota; each state
shall be credited also with all balances of appropriations made by the seventeenth legislative
assembly of the Territory of Dakota for the account of the public institutions, grounds or
buildings situated within its limits, remaining unexpended on March 8, 1889. If there shall be any
indebtedness except the indebtedness represented by the bonds and refunding warrants
hereinbefore mentioned, each state shall at the time of such final adjustment of accounts, assume
its share of said indebtedness as determined by the amount paid on account of the public
institutions, grounds or buildings of such state in excess of the receipts from counties,
municipalities, railroad corporations or persons within the limits of said state, as provided in this
article; and if there should be a surplus at the time of such final adjustment, each state shall be
entitled to the amounts received from counties, municipalities, railroad corporations or persons
within its limits over and above the amount charged it. And the State of North Dakota hereby
obligates itself to pay such part of the debts and liabilities of the Territory of Dakota as is
declared by the foregoing agreement to be its proportion thereof, the same as if such proportion
had been originally created by said State of North Dakota as its own debt or liability.

hereby created for the control and administration of the following state educational institutions,
to wit:
(1) The State University and School of Mines, at Grand Forks, with their substations.
(2) The State Agricultural College and Experiment Station, at Fargo, with their
substations.

       (7)      The School of Forestry, at Bottineau
       (8)      And such other state institutions of higher education as may hereafter be established.

2. (a) The State Board of Higher Education shall consist of seven members, all of whom shall be
qualified electors and taxpayers of the state, and who shall have resided in this state for not less
than five years immediately preceding their appointment, to be appointed by the governor, by and
with the consent of the senate, from a list of names selected as hereinafter provided.
     There shall not be on said board more than one graduate of any one of the institutions
under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Higher Education at any one time.  No person
employed by any institution under the control of the board shall serve as a member of said board,
nor shall any employee of any such institution be eligible for membership on State Board of
Higher Education for a period of two years following the termination of his employment.
     On or before the first day of February, 1939, the governor shall nominate from a list of
three names for each position, selected by the unanimous action of the president of the North
Dakota education association, the chief justice of the supreme court, and the superintendent of
public instruction, and, with the consent of a majority of the members-elect of the senate, shall
appoint from such list as such State Board of Higher Education seven members, whose terms
shall commence on the first day of July, 1939, one of which terms shall expire on the thirtieth
day of June, 1940, and one on the thirtieth day of June in each of the years 1941, 1942, 1943,
1944, 1945, and 1946.  The term of office of members appointed to fill vacancies at the
expiration of said terms shall be for seven years, and in the case of vacancies otherwise arising,
appointments shall be made only for the balance of the term of the members whose places are to
be filled. 
(b) In the event any nomination made by the governor is not consented to and confirmed by the
senate as hereinbefore provided, the governor shall again nominate a candidate for such office,
selected from a new list, prepared in the manner hereinbefore provided, which nomination shall
be submitted to the senate for confirmation, and said proceedings shall be continued until such
appointments have been confirmed by the senate, or the session of the legislature shall have
adjourned.
(c) When any term expires or a vacancy occurs when the legislature is not in session, the
governor may appoint from a list selected as hereinbefore provided, a member who shall
serve until the opening of the next session of the legislature, at which time the appointment shall
be certified to the senate for confirmation, as above provided; and if the appointment be not
confirmed by the thirtieth legislative day of the session, his office shall be deemed vacant and the
governor shall nominate from a list selected as hereinbefore provided, another candidate for such
office and the same proceedings shall be followed as are above set forth; provided further, that
when the legislature shall be in session at any time within six months prior to the date of the
expiration of the term of any member, the governor shall nominate his successor from a list
selected as above set forth, within the first thirty days of such session, and upon confirmation by
the senate such successor shall take office at the expiration of the term of the incumbent. No
person who has been nominated and whose nomination the senate has failed to confirm is
eligible for an interim appointment. 

3. The members of the State Board of Higher Education may only be removed by impeachment
for the offenses and in the manner and according to the procedure provided for the removal of the
governor by impeachment proceedings.

4. Each appointive member of the State Board of Higher Education shall receive such
compensation as may be determined by the legislative assembly for the time actually spent
devoted to the duties of his office, and in addition, shall receive his necessary expenses in the
same manner and amounts as other state officials for attending meetings and performing other
functions of his office. 

5. The legislature shall provide adequate funds for the proper carrying out of the functions and
duties of the State Board of Higher Education.

6. (a) The State Board of Higher Education shall hold its first meeting at the office of the State
Board of Administration at Bismarck, on the 6th day of July, 1939, and shall organize and elect
one of its members as president of such board for a term of one year. It shall also at said meeting,
or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, elect a competent person as secretary, who shall
reside during his term of office in the city of Bismarck, North Dakota. Said secretary shall hold
office at the will of the board. As soon as said board is established and organized, it shall assume
all the powers and perform all the duties now conferred by law upon the Board of Administration
in connection with the several institutions hereinbefore mentioned, and the said Board of
Administration shall immediately upon the organization of said state board of higher education,
surrender and transfer to said State Board of Higher Education all duties, rights, and powers
granted to it under the existing laws of this state concerning the institutions hereinbefore
mentioned, together with all property, deeds, records, reports, and appurtenances of every kind
belonging or appertaining to said institutions.
(b) The said State Board of Higher Education shall have full authority over the institutions under
its control with the right, among its other powers, to prescribe, limit, or modify the courses
offered at the several institutions. In furtherance of its powers, the State Board of Higher
Education shall have the power to delegate to its employees details of the administration of the
institutions under its control. The said State Board of Higher Education shall have full authority
to organize or reorganize within constitutional and statutory limitations, the work of each
institution under its control, and do each and everything necessary and proper for the efficient
and economic administration of said state educational institutions.
(c) Said board shall prescribe for all of said institutions standard systems of accounts and records
and shall biennially, and within six months immediately preceding the regular session of the
legislature, make a report to the governor, covering in detail the operations of the educational
institutions under its control.
(d) It shall be the duty of the heads of the several state institutions hereinbefore mentioned, to
submit the budget requests for the biennial appropriations for said institutions to said State Board
of Higher Education; and said State Board of Higher Education shall consider said budgets and
shall revise the same as in its judgment shall be for the best interests of the educational system of
the state; and thereafter the State Board of Higher Education shall prepare and present to the state
budget board and to the legislature a single unified budget covering the needs of all the
institutions under its control. "Said budget shall be prepared and presented by the Board of
Administration until the State Board of Higher Education organizes as provided in subsection
6a." The appropriations for all of said institutions shall be contained in one legislative measure.
The budgets and appropriation measures for the agricultural experiment stations and their
substations and the extension division of the North Dakota State University of Agriculture and
Applied Science may be separate from those of state educational institutions. 
(e) The said State Board of Higher Education shall have the control of the expenditure of the
funds belonging to, and allocated to such institutions and also those appropriated by the
legislature, for the institutions of higher education in this state; provided, however, that funds
appropriated by the legislature and specifically designated for any one or more of such
institutions, shall not be used for any other institution.

7. (a) The State Board of Higher Education shall, as soon as practicable, appoint for a term of not
to exceed three (3) years, a state commissioner of higher education, whose principal office shall
be at the state capitol, in the city of Bismarck. Said commissioner of higher education shall be
responsible to the State Board of Higher Education and shall be removable by said board for
cause.
(b) The state commissioner of higher education shall be a graduate of some reputable college or
university, and who by training and experience is familiar with the problems peculiar to higher
education.
(c) Such commissioner of higher education shall be the chief executive officer of said State
Board of Higher Education, and shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed by the board.

8. This constitutional provision shall be self-executing and shall become effective without the
necessity of legislative action.

ARTICLE 76
1. Notwithstanding any other provision in the constitution, and for the purpose of promoting the
economic growth of the state, the development of its natural resources and the prosperity and
welfare of its people, the state may issue bonds and use the proceeds thereof to make loans to
privately or cooperatively owned enterprises to plan, construct, acquire, equip improve, and
extend facilities for converting natural resources into power and generating and transmitting such
power, and to acquire real and personal property and water and mineral rights needed for such
facilities.
2. The state may issue general obligation bonds for this purpose to an amount which, with all
outstanding general obligation bonds, less the amount of all money on hand and taxes in process
of collection which are appropriated for their payment, will not exceed five per cent of the full
and true value of all of the taxable property in the state, to be ascertained by the last assessment
made for state and county purposes: but nothing herein shall increase or diminish the limitations
established by other provisions of the constitution on the amount of bonds there in authorized to
be issued.
3. The state may also issue revenue bonds for the purpose of providing part or all of the funds
required for any project undertaken under section 1, payable solely from sums realized from
payments of principal and interest on money loaned from such project, and from other similar
projects if so determined by the legislature, and from the liquidation of security given for such
payments.  Revenue bonds issued for any project shall not exceed the cost thereof, including all
expenses reasonably incurred to complete and finance the project, but shall not be subject to any
other limitation of amount.
4. The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for the prompt and full payment of all
bonds issued under section 2. Its obligation with respect to bonds issued under section 3 shall be

be made respecting the enforcing of the provisions of underlying loan agreements and the
segregation, accounting, and application of bond proceeds and of loan payments and other
security pledged for the payment of the bonds.  All bonds authorized by section 1 to 3, inclusive,
shall mature within forty years from their respective dates of issue, but may be refunded at or
before maturity in such manner and for such term and upon such conditions as the legislature
may direct.  Any such bonds may, but need not be, secured by mortgage upon real or personal
property acquired with the proceeds of the same or any other issue of general obligation or
revenue bonds, or upon other property mortgaged by the debtor.  Pledges of revenues and
mortgages of property securing bonds of any issue may be prior or subordinate to or on a parity
with pledges and mortgages securing any other issue of general obligation or revenue bonds, as
determined by the legislature from time to time in conformity with any provisions made for the
security of outstanding bonds.

1. While the legislative power of this state shall be vested in a legislative
assembly consisting of a senate and a house of representatives, the people reserve the power to
propose and enact laws by the initiative, including the call for a constitutional convention; to
approve or reject legislative Acts, or parts thereof, by the referendum; to propose and adopt
constitutional amendments by the initiative; and to recall certain elected officials. This article is
self-executing and all of its provisions are mandatory. Laws may be enacted to facilitate and
safeguard, but not to hamper, restrict, or impair these powers.
2. A petition to initiate or to refer a measure shall be presented to the secretary
of state for approval as to form. A request for approval shall be presented over the names and
signatures of twenty-five or more electors as sponsors, one of whom shall be designated as
chairman of the sponsoring committee. The secretary of state shall approve the petition for
circulation if it is in proper form and contains the names and addresses of the sponsors and the
full text of the measure. 
3. The petition shall be circulated only by electors. They shall swear thereon that the electors who
have signed the petition did so in their presence. Each elector signing a petition shall also write in
the date of signing and his post-office address. No law shall be enacted limiting the number of
copies of a petition. The copies shall become part of the original petition when filed.
4.  The petition may be submitted to the secretary of state if signed by electors
equal in number to two percent of the resident population of the state at the last federal decennial
census.
5. An initiative petition shall be submitted not less than ninety days before the statewide election
at which the measure is to be voted upon. A referendum petition may be submitted only within
ninety days after the filing of the measure with the secretary of state. The submission of a petition
shall suspend the operation of any measure enacted by the legislative assembly except emergency
measures and appropriation measures for the support and maintenance of state departments and
institutions. The submission of a petition against one or more items or parts of any measure shall
not prevent the remainder from going into effect. A referred measure may be voted upon at a
statewide election or at a special election called by the governor.
6. The secretary of state shall pass upon each petition, and if he finds it insufficient, he shall
notify the "committee for the petitioners" and allow twenty days for correction or amendment.
All decisions of the secretary of state in regard to any such petition shall be subject to review by
the supreme court. But if the sufficiency of such petition is being reviewed at the time the ballot
is prepared, the secretary of state shall place the measure on the ballot and no subsequent
decision shall invalidate such measure if it is at such election approved by a majority of the votes
cast thereon. If proceedings are brought against any petition upon any ground, the burden of
proof shall be upon the party attacking it.
7. All decisions of the secretary of state in the petition process are subject to review by the
supreme court in the exercise of original jurisdiction. If his decision is being reviewed at the time
the ballot is prepared, he shall place the measure on the ballot and no court action shall invalidate
the measure if it is approved at the election by a majority of the votes cast thereon.
8. If a majority of votes cast upon an initiated or a referred measure are affirmative, it shall be
deemed enacted. An initiated or referred measure which is approved shall become law thirty days
after the election, and a referred measure which is rejected shall be void immediately. If
conflicting measures are approved, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes
shall be law. A measure approved by the electors may not be repealed or amended by the
legislative assembly for seven years from its effective date, except by a two-thirds vote of the
members elected to each house.
9. A constitutional amendment may be proposed by initiative petition. If signed
by electors equal in number to four percent of the resident population of the state at the last
federal decennial census, the petition may be submitted to the secretary of state. All other
provisions relating to initiative measures apply hereto.
10. Any elected official of the state, of any county or of any legislative or county
commissioner district shall be subject to recall by petition of electors equal in number to
twenty-five percent of those who voted at the preceding general election for the office of
governor in the state, county, or district in which the official is to be recalled.
The petition shall be filed with the official with whom a petition for nomination to the
office in question is filed, who shall call a special election if he finds the petition valid and
sufficient. No elector may remove his name from a recall petition.
The name of the official to be recalled shall be placed on the ballot unless he resigns
within ten days after the filing of the petition. Other candidates for the office may be nominated
in a manner provided by law. When the election results have been officially declared, the
candidate receiving the highest number of votes shall be deemed elected for the remainder of the
term. No official shall be subject twice to recall during the term for which he was elected.
