Whereas the Congress of the United States did by an act approved on the twenty-second day of

Territory of Washington might, upon the conditions prescribed in said act, become the State of
Washington; 
And whereas it was provided by said act that delegates elected as therein provided, to a
Constitutional convention in the Territory of Washington, should meet at the seat of government
of said Territory; and that, after they had met and organized they should declare on behalf of the
people of  Washington that they adopt the Constitution of the United States; whereupon the said
convention should be authorized to form a State Government for the proposed State of
Washington; 
And whereas it was provided by said act that the Constitution so adopted should be republican
in form and make no distinction in civil or political rights on account of race or color, except as
to Indians not taxed, and not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and the
principles of the Declaration of Independence; and that the Convention should by an ordinance
irrevocable without the consent of the United States and the people of said State make certain
provisions prescribed in said act; 
And whereas it was provided by said act that the Constitution thus formed for the people of
Washington should, by an ordinary of the Convention forming the same, be submitted to the
people of Washington at an election to be held therein on the first Tuesday in October, eighteen
hundred and eighty-nine, for ratification or rejection by the qualified voters of said proposed
State; and that the returns of said election should be made to the Secretary of said Territory, who,
with the Governor and Chief justice thereof, or any two of them, should canvass the same; and if
a majority of the legal votes cast should be for the Constitution, the Governor should certify the
result to the President of the United States, together with a statement of the votes cast thereon,
and upon separate articles or propositions and a copy of said Constitution, articles, propositions
and ordinances; 
And whereas it has been certified to me by the Governor of said Territory that within the time
prescribed by said act of Congress a Constitution for the proposed State of Washington has been
adopted and that the same, has been ratified by a majority of the qualified voters of said proposed
State in accordance with the conditions prescribed in said act; 
And whereas it is also certified to me by the said Governor that at the same time the body of
said Constitution was submitted to a vote of the people two separate articles entitled "Woman
Suffrage" and "Prohibition" were likewise submitted, which said separate articles did not receive
a majority of the votes cast thereon or upon the Constitution and were rejected; also that at the
same election the question of the location of a permanent seat of government was so submitted
and that no place receive a majority of all the votes cast upon said question; 
And whereas a duly authenticated copy of said Constitution and articles, as required by said
act, has been received by me: 
Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of America, do, in
accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress aforesaid, declare and proclaim the fact
that the conditions imposed by Congress on the State of Washington to entitle that State to
admission to the Union have been ratified and accepted and that the admission of the said State
into the Union is now complete.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to
be affixed.
 Done at the City of Washington this eleventh (11th) day of November in the year of our Lord

    Art. 2 Section 1 LEGISLATIVE POWERS, WHERE VESTED. The legislative authority of
the state of Washington shall be vested in the legislature, consisting of a senate and house of
representatives, which shall be called the legislature of the state of Washington, but the people
reserve to themselves the power to propose bills, laws, and to enact or reject the same at the
polls, independent of the legislature, and also reserve power, at their own option,  to approve or
reject at the polls any act, item, section or part of any bill, act or law passed by the legislature.
(a) Initiative: The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Ten per centum, but in no
case more than fifty thousand, of the legal voters shall be required to propose any measure by
such petition, and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed.
Initiative petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than four months before the
election at which they are to be voted upon, or not less than ten days before any regular session
of the legislature. If filed at least four months before the election at which they are to be voted
upon, he shall submit the same to the vote of the people at the said election. If such petitions are
filed not less than ten days before any regular session of the legislature, he shall transmit the
same to the legislature as soon as it convenes and organizes. Such initiative measure shall take
precedence over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills and shall be either
enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such
regular session. If any such initiative measure shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be
subject to the referendum petition, or it may be enacted and referred by the legislature to the
people for approval or rejection at the next regular election. If it is rejected or if no action is
taken upon it by the legislature before the end of such regular session, the secretary of state shall
submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. The
legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different one
dealing with the same subject, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the
secretary of state to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general
election. When conflicting measures are submitted to the people the ballots shall be so printed
that a voter can express separately by making one cross (X) for each, two preferences, first, as
between either measure and neither, and secondly, as between one and the other. If the majority
of those voting on the first issue is for neither, both fail, but in that case the votes on the second
issue shall nevertheless be carefully counted and made public. If a majority voting on the first
issue is for either, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes on the second issue shall be
law.
(b) Referendum. The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and it may be
ordered on any act, bill, law, or any part thereof passed by the legislature, except such laws as
may be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, support of
the state government and its existing public institutions, either by petition signed by the required
percentage of the legal voters, or by the legislature as other bills are enacted. Six per centum, but
in no case more than thirty thousand, of the legal voters shall be required to sign and make a
valid referendum petition. 
(c) No act, law, or bill subject to referendum shall take effect until ninety days after the
adjournment of the session at which it was enacted. No act, law, or bill approved by a majority of
the electors voting thereon shall be amended or repealed by the legislature within a period of two
years following such enactment. But such enactment may be amended or repealed at any general
regular or special election by direct vote of the people thereon.
(d) The filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of any act,
law or bill shall not delay the remainder of the measure from becoming operative. Referendum
petitions against measures passed by the legislature shall be filed with the secretary of state not
later than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature which passed
the measure on which the referendum is demanded. The veto power of the governor shall not
extend to measures initiated by or referred to the people. All elections on measures referred to
the people of the state shall be had at the biennial regular elections, except when the legislature
shall order a special election. Any measure initiated by the people or referred to the people as
herein provided shall take effect and become the law if it is approved by a majority of the votes
cast thereon: Provided, That the vote cast upon such question or measure shall equal one-third of
the total votes cast at such election and not otherwise. Such measure shall be in operation on and
after the thirtieth day after the election at which it is approved. The style of all bills proposed by
initiative petition shall be: "Be it enacted by the people of the State of Washington." This section
shall not be construed to deprive any member of the legislature of the right to introduce any
measure. The whole number of electors who voted for governor at the regular gubernatorial
election last preceding the filing of any petition for the initiative or for the referendum shall be
the basis on which the number of legal voters necessary to sign such petition shall be counted.
All such petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall be guided by the general
laws in submitting the same to the people until additional legislation shall especially provide
therefor. This section is self-executing, but legislation may be enacted especially to facilitate its
operation.
The legislature shall provide methods of publicity of all laws or parts of laws, and amendments
to the constitution referred to the people with arguments for and against the laws and
amendments so referred, so that each voter of the state shall receive the publication at least fifty
days before the election at which they are to be voted upon.

    Art. 11 Section 4 COUNTY GOVERNMENT AND TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION. The
legislature shall establish a system of county government, which shall be uniform throughout the
state except as hereinafter provided, and by general laws shall provide for township organization,
under which any county may organize whenever a majority of the qualified electors of such
county voting at a general election shall so determine; and whenever a county shall adopt
township organization, the assessment and collection of the revenue shall be made, and the
business of such county and the local affairs of the several townships therein, shall be managed
and transacted in the manner prescribed by such general law.
Any county may frame a "Home Rule" charter for its own government subject to the Constitution
and laws of this state, and for such purpose the legislative authority of such county may cause an
election to be had, at which election there shall be chosen by the qualified voters of said county
not less than fifteen (15) nor more than twenty-five (25) freeholders thereof, as determined by the
legislative authority, who shall have been residents of said county for a period of at least five (5)
years preceding their election and who are themselves qualified electors, whose duty it shall be to
convene within thirty (30) days after their election and prepare and propose a charter for such
county. Such proposed charter shall be submitted to the qualified electors of said county, and if a
majority of such qualified electors of voting thereon ratify the same, it shall become the charter
of said county and shall become the organic law thereof, and supersede any existing charter,
including amendments thereto, or any existing form of county government, and all special laws
inconsistent with such charter. Said proposed charter shall be published in two (2) legal
newspapers published in said county, at least once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks prior to
the day of submitting the same to the electors for their approval as above provided. All elections
in this section authorized shall only be had upon notice, which notice shall specify the object of
calling such election and shall be given for at least ten (10) days before the day of election in all
election districts of said county. Said elections may be general or special elections and except as
herein provided, shall be governed by the law regulating and controlling general or special
elections in said county. Such charter may be amended by proposals therefor submitted by the
legislative authority of said county to the electors thereof at any general election after notice of
such submission published as above specified, and ratified by a majority of the qualified electors
voting thereon. In submitting any such charter or amendment thereto, any alternate article or
proposition may be presented for the choice of the voters and may be voted on separately without
prejudice to others.
Any home rule charter proposed as herein provided, may provide for such county officers as may
be deemed necessary to carry out and perform all county functions as provided by charter or by
general law, and for their compensation, but shall not affect the election of the prosecuting
attorney, the county superintendent of schools, the judges of the superior court, and the justices
of the peace, or the jurisdiction of he courts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision for the calling of an election by the legislative authority
of such county for the election of freeholders to frame a county charter, registered voters equal in
number to ten (10) per centum of the voters of my such county voting at the last preceding
general election, may at any time propose by petition the caking of an election of freeholders.
The petition shall be filed with the county auditor of the county at least three (3) months before
any general election and the proposal that a board of freeholders be elected for the purpose of
framing a county charter shall be submitted to the vote of the people at said general election, and
at the same election a board of freeholders of not less than fifteen (15) or more than twenty-five
(25), as fixed in the petition calling for the action, shall be chosen to draft the new charter. The
procedure for the nomination of qualified electors as candidates for said board of freeholders
shall be prescribed by the legislative authority of the county, and the procedure for the framing of
the charter and the submission of the charter as framed shall be the same as in the case of a board
of freeholders chosen at an election initiated by the legislative authority if the county.
In calling for any election of freeholders as provided in this section, the legislative authority of
the county shall apportion the number of freeholders to be elected in accordance with either the
legislative districts or the county commissioner districts, if any, within said county, the number
of said freeholders to be elected from each of said districts to be in proportion to the population
of said districts as nearly as may be.
Should the charter proposed receive the affirmative vote of the majority of the electors voting
thereon, the legislative authority of the county shall immediately gall such special election as
may be provided for therein, if any, and the county government shall be established in
accordance with the terms of said charter not more than six (6) months after the election at which
the charter was adopted.
The terms of all elective officers, except the prosecuting attorney, the county superintendent of
schools, the judges of the superior court, and the justices of the peace, who are in office at the
time of the adoption of a Home Rule Charter shall terminate as provided in the charter. All
appointive officers in office at the time the charter goes into effect, whose positions are not
abolished thereby, shall continue until their successors shall have qualified.
After the adoption of such charter, such county shall continue to have all the rights, powers,
privileges and benefits then possessed or thereafter conferred by general law. All the powers,
authority and duties granted to and imposed on county officers by general law, except the
prosecuting attorney, the county superintendent of schools, the judges of the superior court and
the justices of the peace, shall be vested in the legislative authority of the county unless expressly
vested in specific officers by the charter. The legislative authority may by resolution delegate any
of its executive or administrative powers, authority or duties not expressly vested in specific
officers by the charter, to any county officer or officers or county employee or employees.
The provisions of sections 5, 6, 7, and the first sentence of section 8 of this Article as amended
shall not apply to counties in which the government has been established by charter adopted
under the provisions hereof the authority conferred on the board of county commissioners by
Section 15 of Article II as amended, shall be exercised by the legislative authority of the county.

shall exercise any police, taxation or other powers within the territorial limits of such county and
city, but all such powers shall be exercised by the city and county and the officers thereof,
subject to such constitutional provisions and general laws as apply to either cities or counties:
Provided, That the provisions of sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this article shall not apply to

of a city and county shall not be changed after his election or appointment or during his term of
office; nor shall the term of any such officer be extended beyond the period for which he is
elected or appointed. In case an existing county is divided in the formation of a city and county,
such city and county shall be liable for a just proportion of the existing debts or liabilities of the
former county, and shall account or and pay the county remaining a just proportion of the value
of any real estate or other property owned by the former county and taken over by the county and
city,  the method of determining such just proportion to be prescribed by general law, but such
division shall not affect the rights of creditors. The officers of a city and county, their
compensation, qualifications, term of office and manner of election or appointment shall be as
provided for in its charter, subject to general laws and applicable constitutional provisions.

Art. 2 Section 1 LEGISLATIVE POWERS, WHERE VESTED. The legislative authority of the
state of Washington shall be vested in the legislature, consisting of a senate and house of
representatives, which shall be called the legislature of the state of Washington, but the people
reserve to themselves the power to propose bills, laws, and to enact or reject the same at the
polls, independent of the legislature, and also reserve power, at their own option, to approve or
reject at the polls any act, item, section or part of any bill, act or law passed by the legislature.
(a) Initiative: The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Ten per centum, but in no
case more than fifty thousand, of the legal voters shall be required to propose any measure by
such petition, and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed.
Initiative petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than four months before the
election at which they are to be voted upon, or not less than ten days before any regular session
of the legislature. If filed at least four months before the election at which they are to be voted
upon, he shall submit the same to the vote of the people at the said election. If such petitions are
filed not less than ten days before any regular session of the legislature, he shall transmit the
same to the legislature as soon as it convenes and organizes. Such initiative measure shall take
precedence over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills and shall be either
enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such
regular session. If any such initiative measure shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be
subject to the referendum petition, or it may be enacted and referred by the legislature to the
people for approval or rejection at the next regular election. If it is rejected or if no action is
taken upon it by the legislature before the end of such regular session, the secretary of state shall
submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. The
legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different one
dealing with the same subject, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the
secretary of state to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general
election. When conflicting measures are submitted to the people the ballots shall be so printed
that a voter can express separately by making one cross (X) for each, two preferences, first, as
between either measure and neither, and secondly, as between one and the other. If the majority
of those voting on the first issue is for neither, both fail, but in that case the votes on the second
issue shall nevertheless be carefully counted and made public. If a majority voting on the first
issue is for either, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes on the second issue shall be
law.
(b) Referendum. The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and it may be
ordered on any act, bill, law, or any part thereof passed by the legislature, except such laws as
may be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, support of
the state government and its existing public institutions, either by petition signed by the required
percentage of the legal voters, or by the legislature as other bills are enacted. Six per centum, but
in no case more than thirty thousand, of the legal voters shall be required to sign and make a
valid referendum petition. 
(c) No act, law, or bill subject to referendum shall take effect until ninety days after the
adjournment of the session at which it was enacted. No act, law, or bill approved by a majority of
the electors voting thereon shall be amended or repealed by the legislature within a period of two
years following such enactment. But such enactment may be amended or repealed at any general
regular or special election by direct vote of the people thereon.
(d) The filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of any act,
law or bill shall not delay the remainder of the measure from becoming operative. Referendum
petitions against measures passed by the legislature shall be filed with the secretary of state not
later than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature which passed
the measure on which the referendum is demanded. The veto power of the governor shall not
extend to measures initiated by or referred to the people. All elections on measures referred to
the people of the state shall be had at the biennial regular elections, except when the legislature
shall order a special election. Any measure initiated by the people or referred to the people as
herein provided shall take effect and become the law if it is approved by a majority of the votes
cast thereon: Provided, That the vote cast upon such question or measure shall equal one-third of
the total votes cast at such election and not otherwise. Such measure shall be in operation on and
after the thirtieth day after the election at which it is approved. The style of all bills proposed by
initiative petition shall be: "Be it enacted by the people of the State of Washington." This section
shall not be construed to deprive any member of the legislature of the right to introduce any
measure. The whole number of electors who voted for governor at the regular gubernatorial
election last preceding the filing of any petition for the initiative or for the referendum shall be
the basis on which the number of legal voters necessary to sign such petition shall be counted.
All such petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall be guided by the general
laws in submitting the same to the people until additional legislation shall especially provide
therefor. This section is self-executing, but legislation may be enacted especially to facilitate its
operation.
The legislature shall provide methods of publicity of all laws or parts of laws, and amendments
to the constitution referred to the people with arguments for and against the laws and
amendments so referred, so that each voter of the state shall receive the publication at least fifty
days before the election at which they are to be voted upon.
Article 2, section 1, subsection (e). The legislature shall provide methods of publicity of all laws
or parts of laws, and amendments to the Constitution referred to the people with arguments for
and against the laws and amendments so referred. The secretary of state shall send one copy of
the publication to each individual place of residence in the state and shall make such additional
distribution as he shall determine necessary to reasonably assure that each voter will have an
opportunity to study the measures prior to election. These provisions supersede the provisions set
forth in the last paragraph of section 1 of this article as amended by the seventh amendment to
the Constitution of this state.

subject to the Constitution and laws of this state to provide for the formation and government of
combined city and county municipal corporations, each of which shall be known as "city-
county". Registered voters equal in number to ten (10) percent of the voters of any such county
voting at the last preceding general election may at any time propose by a petition the calling of
an election of freeholders. The provisions of section 4 of this Article with respect to a petition
calling for an election of freeholders to frame a county home rule charter, the election of
freeholders, and the framing and adoption of a county home rule charter pursuant to such petition
shall apply to a petition proposed under this section for the election of freeholders to frame a
city-county charter, the election of freeholders, and to the framing and adoption of such city-
county charter pursuant to such petition. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
provisions of section 4 applicable to a county home rule charter shall apply to a city-county
charter. If there are not sufficient legal newspapers published in the county to meet the
requirements for publication of a proposed charter under section 4 of this Article, publication in
a legal newspaper circulated in the county may be substituted for publication in a legal
newspaper published in the county. No such "city-county" shall be formed except by a majority
vote of the qualified electors voting thereon in the county. The charter shall designate the
respective officers of such city-county who shall perform the duties imposed by law upon county
officers. Every such city-county shall have and enjoy all rights, powers and privileges asserted in
its charter, and in addition thereto, such rights, powers and privileges as may be granted to it, or
to any city or county or class or classes of cities and counties. In the event of a conflict in the
constitutional provisions applying to cities and those applying to counties or of a conflict in the
general laws applying to cities and those applying to counties, a city-county shall be authorized
to exercise any powers that are granted to either the cities or the counties.
No legislative enactment which is a prohibition or restriction shall apply to the rights, powers
and privileges of a city-county unless such prohibition or restriction shall apply equally to every
other city, county, and city-county.
The provisions of sections 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 and of the first paragraph of section 4 of this Article
shall not apply to any such city-county.
Municipal corporations may be retained or otherwise provided for within the city-county. The
formation, powers and duties of such municipal corporations shall be prescribed by the charter.
No city-county shall for any purpose become indebted in any manner to an amount exceeding
three per centum of the taxable property in such city-county without the assent of three-fifths of
the voters therein voting at an election to be held for that purpose, nor in cases requiring such
assent shall the total indebtedness at any time exceed ten per centum of the value of the taxable
property therein, to be ascertained by the last assessment for city-county purposes previous to the
incurring of such indebtedness: Provided, That no part of the indebtedness allowed in this section
shall be incurred for any purpose other than strictly city-county or other municipal purposes:
Provided further, That any city-county, with such assent may be allowed to become indebted to a
larger amount, but not exceeding five per centum additional for supplying such city-county with
water, artificial light, and sewers, when the works for supplying such water, light, and sewers
shall be owned and controlled by the city-county.
No municipal corporation which is retained or otherwise provided for within the city-county
shall for any purpose become indebted in any manner to an amount exceeding one and one-half
per centum of the taxable property in such municipal corporation without the assent of three-
fifths of the voters therein voting at an election to be held for that purpose, nor shall the total
indebtedness at any time exceed five per centum of the value of the taxable property therein, to
be ascertained by the last assessment for city-county purposes previous to the incurring of such
indebtedness: Provided, That no part of the indebtedness allowed in this section shall be incurred
for any purpose other than strictly municipal purposes: Provided further, That any such
municipal corporation, with such assent, may be allowed to become indebted to a larger amount,
but not exceeding five per centum additional for supplying such municipal corporation with
water, artificial light, and sewers, when the works for supplying such water, light, and sewers
shall be owned and controlled by the municipal corporation. All taxes which are levied and
collected within a municipal corporation for a specific purpose shall be expended within that
municipal corporation.
The authority conferred on the city-county government shall not be restricted by the second
sentence of Article 7, section 1, or by Article 8, section 6 of this Constitution. [1971 House Joint

are required to be repaid, directly or indirectly, from general state revenues and which are
incurred by the state, any department, authority, public corporation, or quasi public corporation

thereon, or fund or refund, at or prior to maturity, the whole or any part of any indebtedness
incurred or authorized prior to the effective date of this amendment by any entity of the type
described in subsection (g) of this section, including any premium payable with respect thereto

contracted after the effective date of this amendment by the Washington state building authority,
the capitol committee, or any similar entity existing or operating for similar purposes pursuant to
which such entity undertakes to finance or provide a facility for use or occupancy by the state or
any agency, department, or instrumentality thereof.
(h) The legislature shall prescribe all matters relating to the contracting, funding or refunding of
debt pursuant to this section, including: The purposes for which debt may be contracted, by a
favorable vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house, the amount of debt which
may be contracted for any class of such purposes; the kinds of notes, bonds, or other evidences of

may be issued only to provide for appropriations already made by the legislature and such
certificates must be retired and the debt discharged other than by refunding within twelve months
after the date of incurrence.

Art. 2 Section 1 LEGISLATIVE POWERS, WHERE VESTED. The legislative authority of the
state of Washington shall be vested in the legislature, consisting of a senate and house of
representatives, which shall be called the legislature of the state of Washington, but the people
reserve to themselves the power to propose bills, laws, and to enact or reject the same at the
polls, independent of the legislature, and also reserve power, at their own option, to approve or
reject at the polls any act, item, section, or part of any bill, act, or law passed by the legislature.
(a) Initiative: The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Every such petition shall
include the full text of the measure so proposed. In the case of initiatives to the legislature and
initiatives to the people, the number of valid signatures of legal voters required shall be equal to
eight percent of the votes cast for the office of governor at the last gubernatorial election
preceding the initial filing of the text of the initiative measure with the secretary of state.
Initiative petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than four months before the
election at which they are to be voted upon, or not less than ten days before any regular session
of the legislature. If filed at least four months before the election at which they are to be voted
upon, he shall submit the same to the vote of the people at the said election. If such petitions are
filed not less than ten days before any regular session of the legislature, he shall certify the
results within forty days of the filing. If certification is not complete by the date that the
legislature convenes, he shall provisionally certify the measure pending final certification of the
measure. Such initiative measures, whether certified or provisionally certified, shall take
precedence over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills and shall be either
enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such
regular session. If any such initiative measures shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be
subject to the referendum petition, or it may be enacted and referred by the legislature to the
people for approval or rejection at the next regular election. If it is rejected or if no action is
taken upon it by the legislature before the end of such regular session, the secretary of state shall
submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. The
legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different one
dealing with the same subject, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the
secretary of state to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general
election. When conflicting measures are submitted to the people the ballots shall be so printed
that a voter can express separately by making one cross (X) for each, two preferences, first, as
between either measure and neither, and secondly, as between one and the other. If the majority
of those voting on the first issue is for neither, both fail, but in that case the votes on the second
issue shall nevertheless be carefully counted and made public. If a majority voting on the first
issue is for either, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes on the second issue shall be
law.
(b) Referendum. The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and it may be
ordered on any act, bill, law, or any part thereof passed by the legislature, except such laws as
may be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, support of
the state government and its existing public institutions, either by petition signed by the required
percentage of the legal voters, or by the legislature as other bills are enacted: Provided, That the
legislature may not order a referendum on any initiative measure enacted by the legislature under
the foregoing subsection (a). The number of valid signatures of registered voters required on a
petition for referendum of an act of the legislature or any part thereof, shall be equal to or
exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the office of governor at the last gubernatorial
election preceding the filing of the text of the referendum measure with the secretary of state.
(c) No act, law, or bill subject to referendum shall take effect until ninety days after the
adjournment of the session at which it was enacted. No act, law, or bill approved by a majority of
the electors voting thereon shall be amended or repealed by the legislature within a period of two
years following such enactment: Provided, That any such act, law, or bill may be amended within
two years after such enactment at any regular or special session of the legislature by a vote of
two-thirds of all the members elected to each house with full compliance with section 12, Article
III, of the Washington Constitution, and no amendatory law adopted in accordance with this
provision shall be subject to referendum. But such enactment may be amended or repealed at any
general regular or special election by direct vote of the people thereon.
(d) The filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections, or parts of any act,
law, or bill shall not delay the remainder of the measure from becoming operative. Referendum
petitions against measures passed by the legislature shall be filed with the secretary of state not
later than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature which passed
the measure on which the referendum is demanded. The veto power of the governor shall not
extend to measures initiated by or referred to the people. All elections on measures referred to
the people of the state shall be had at the next succeeding regular general election following the
filing of the measure with the secretary of state, except when the legislature shall order a special
election. Any measure initiated by the people or referred to the people as herein provided shall
take effect and become the law if it is approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon: Provided,
That the vote cast upon such question or measure shall equal one-third of the total votes cast at
such election and not otherwise. Such measure shall be in operation on and after the thirtieth day
after the election at which it is approved. The style of all bills proposed by initiative petition shall
be: "Be it enacted by the people of the State of Washington. " This section shall not be construed
to deprive any member of the legislature of the right to introduce any measure. All such petitions
shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall be guided by the general laws in submitting
the same to the people until additional legislation shall especially provide therefor. This section
is self-executing, but legislation may be enacted especially to facilitate its operation.
(e) The legislature shall provide methods of publicity of all laws or parts of laws, and
amendments to the Constitution referred to the people with arguments for and against the laws
and amendments so referred. The secretary of state shall send one copy of the publication to each
individual place of residence in the state and shall make such additional distribution as he shall
determine necessary to reasonably assure that each voter will have an opportunity to study the
measure prior to election. [1981 Substitute Senate Joint Resolution No. 133. Approves

Art. 1 Section 35 VICTIMS OF CRIMES - RIGHTS. Effective law enforcement depends on
cooperation from victims of crime. To ensure victims a meaningful role in the criminal justice
system and to accord them due dignity and respect, victims of crime are hereby granted the
following basic and fundamental rights.
Upon notifying the prosecuting attorney, a victim of a crime charged as a felony shall have the
right to be informed of and, subject to the discretion of the individual presiding over the trial or
court proceedings, attend trial and all other court proceedings the defendant has the right to
attend, and to make a statement at sentencing and at any proceeding where the defendant's
release is considered, subject to the same rules of procedure which govern the defendant's rights.
In the event the victim is deceased, incompetent, a minor, or otherwise unavailable, the
prosecuting attorney may identify a representative to appear to exercise the victim's rights. This
provision shall not constitute a basis for error in favor of a defendant in a criminal proceeding
nor a basis for providing a victim or the victim's representative with court appointed counsel.

Art. 4 Section 31 COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT. (1) There shall be a commission
on judicial conduct, existing as an independent agency of the judicial branch, and consisting of a
judge selected by and from the court of appeals judges, a judge selected by and from the superior
court judges, a judge selected by and from the district court judges, two persons admitted to the
practice of law in this state selected by the state bar association, and six persons who are not
attorneys appointed by the governor.
(2) Whenever the commission receives a complaint against a judge or justice, or otherwise has
reason to believe that a judge or justice should be admonished, reprimanded, censured,
suspended, removed, or retired, the commission shall first investigate the complaint or belief and
then conduct initial proceedings for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists for
conducting a public hearing or hearings to deal with the complaint or belief. The investigation
and initial
proceedings shall be confidential. Upon beginning an initial proceeding, the commission shall
notify the judge or justice of the existence of and basis for the initial proceeding.
(3) Whenever the commission concludes, based on an initial proceeding, that there is probable
cause to believe that a judge or justice has violated a rule of judicial conduct or that the judge or
justice suffers from a disability which is permanent or likely to become permanent and which
seriously interferes with the performance of judicial duties, the commission shall conduct a
public hearing or hearings and shall make public all those records of the initial proceeding that
provide the basis for its conclusion. If the commission concludes that there is not probable cause,
it shall notify the judge or justice of its conclusion.
(4) Upon the completion of the hearing or hearings, the commission in open session shall either
dismiss the case, or shall admonish, reprimand, or censure the judge or justice, or shall censure
the judge or justice and recommend to the supreme court the suspension or removal of the judge
or justice, or shall recommend to the supreme court the retirement of the judge or justice. The
commission may not recommend suspension or removal unless it censures the judge or justice
for the violation serving as the basis for the recommendation. The commission may recommend
retirement of a judge or justice for a disability which is permanent or likely to become permanent
and which seriously interferes with the performance of judicial duties.
(5) Upon the recommendation of the commission, the supreme court may suspend, remove, or
retire a judge or justice. The office of a judge or justice retired or removed by the supreme court
becomes vacant, and that person is ineligible for judicial office until eligibility is reinstated by
the supreme court. The salary of a removed judge or justice shall cease. The supreme court shall
specify the effect upon salary when it suspends a judge or justice. The supreme court may not
suspend, remove, or retire a judge or justice until the commission, after notice and hearing,
recommends that action be taken, and the supreme court conducts a hearing, after notice, to
review commission proceedings and findings against the judge or justice.
(6) Within thirty days after the commission admonishes, reprimands, or censures a judge or
justice, the judge or justice shall have a right of appeal de novo to the supreme court.
(7) Any matter before the commission or supreme court may be disposed of by a stipulation
entered into in a public proceeding. The stipulation shall be signed by the judge or justice and the
commission or court. The stipulation may impose any terms and conditions deemed appropriate
by the commission or court. A stipulation shall set forth all material facts relating to the
proceeding and the conduct of the judge or justice.
(8) Whenever the commission adopts a recommendation that a judge or justice be removed, the
judge or justice shall be suspended immediately, with salary, from his or her judicial position
until a final determination is made by the supreme court.
(9) The legislature shall provide for commissioners' terms of office and compensation. The
commission shall employ one or more investigative officers with appropriate professional
training and experience. The investigative officers of the commission shall report directly to the
commission. The commission shall also employ such administrative or other staff as are
necessary to manage the affairs of the commission.
(10) The commission shall, to the extent that compliance does not conflict with this section,
comply with laws of general applicability to state agencies with respect to rule-making
procedures, and with respect to public notice of and attendance at commission proceedings other
than initial proceedings. The commission shall establish rules of procedure for commission
proceedings including due process and confidentiality of proceedings. [1989 Substitute Senate
Joint Resolution No. 8202. Approved November 7, 1989.]

Art. 1 Section 11 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of
religious sentiment, belief and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall
be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of religion; but the liberty of
conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify
practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state. No public money or property shall be
appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise or instruction, or the support of any
religious establishment: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That this article shall not be so construed as
to forbid the employment by the state of a chaplain for such of the state custodial, correctional,
and mental institutions, or by a county's or public hospital district's hospital, health care facility,
or hospice, as in the discretion of the legislature may seem justified. No religious qualification
shall be required for any public office or employment, nor shall any person be incompetent as a
witness or juror, in consequence of his opinion on matters of religion, nor be questioned in any
court of justice touching his religious belief to affect the weight of his testimony.

not in any year exceed one percent of the true and fair value of such property in money:
Provided, however, That nothing herein shall prevent levies at the rates now provided by law by

(a) By any taxing district when specifically authorized so to do by a majority of at least three-
fifths of the voters of the taxing district voting on the proposition to levy such additional tax
submitted not more than twelve months prior to the date on which the proposed levy is to be
made and not oftener than twice in such twelve month period, either at a special election or at the
regular election of such taxing district, at which election the number of voters voting "yes" on the
proposition shall constitute three-fifths of a number equal to forty percent of the total number of
voters voting in such taxing district at the last preceding general election when the number of
voters voting on the proposition does not exceed forty percent of the total number of voters
voting in such taxing district in the last preceding general election; or by a majority of at least
three-fifths of the voters of the taxing district voting on the proposition to levy when the number
of voters voting on the proposition exceeds forty percent of the number of voters voting in such
taxing district in the last preceding general election: Provided, That notwithstanding any other
provision of this Constitution, any proposition pursuant to this subsection to levy additional tax
for the support of the common schools may provide such support for a period of up to four years
and any proposition to levy an additional tax to support the construction, modernization, or
remodeling of school facilities may provide such support for a period not exceeding six years;
(b) By any taxing district otherwise authorized by law to issue general obligation bonds for
capital purposes, for the sole purpose of making the required payments of principal and interest
on general obligation bonds issued solely for capital purposes, other than the replacement of
equipment, when authorized so to do by majority of at least three-fifths of the voters of the
taxing district voting on the proposition to issue such bonds and to pay the principal and interest
thereon by annual tax levies in excess of the limitation herein provided during the term of such
bonds, submitted not oftener than twice in any calendar year, at an election held in the manner
provided by law for bond elections in such taxing district, at which election the total number of
voters voting on the proposition shall constitute not less than forty percent of the total number of
voters voting in such taxing district at the last preceding general election: Provided, That any
such taxing district shall have the right by vote of its governing body to refund any general
obligation bonds of said district issued for capital purposes only, and to provide for the interest
thereon and amortization thereof by annual levies in excess of the tax limitation provided for
herein, And provided further, That the provisions of this section shall also be subject to the
limitations contained in Article VIII, Section 6, of this Constitution;
(c) By the state or any taxing district for the purpose of preventing the impairment of the
obligation of a contract when ordered so to do by a court of last resort. [House Joint Resolution
