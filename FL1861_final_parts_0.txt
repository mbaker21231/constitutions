       WHEREAS, By act of the General Assembly of the State of Florida, a Convention,

  January, A. D. 1861, "for the purpose of taking into consideration the dangers incident to

  Florida so far as the same, in the judgment of said Convention, may be necessary, and

  pursuance of said act, assemble in Convention on the day and in the place therein specified,
  and being thus charged with the duties aforesaid, after mature deliberation, and in
  considerate performance thereof, did on the 10th day of January, in the year of our Lord on
  thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, in Convention as aforesaid, ordain, publish and
  declare "That the State of Florida hereby withdraws herself from the Confederacy of States,
  existing under the name of the United States of America, and from the existing Government
  of said States, and that all political connection between her and the Government of said
  States ought to be and the same is hereby totally annulled, and said Union of States
  dissolved, and the State of Florida declared a sovereign and independent Nation; and that all
  ordinances heretofore adopted, in so far as they create or recognize said Union, are
  rescinded, and all laws or parts of laws in force in this State, in so far as they recognize or
  assent to said Union, be and they are hereby repealed;"
       And whereas, The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled,
  had dissolved their connection with the Government of the United States of America, and
  invited such other of the slaveholding States, as might, in like manner declare their
  independence, to meet her in Convention at Montgomery, in the State of Alabama, for the
  purpose of forming a new Government;
       And whereas, This Convention did appoint three delegates to meet in a Convention
  of States at Montgomery aforesaid, on the 13th day of February last, or at such other time
  and place as might be agreed upon, the delegates of such other slaveholding States, as then
  had or should have, before the final adjournment of said Convention dissolved their
  connection with the late Federal Union, for the purpose, among other things, of forming a
  "Permanent Government" for a Confederacy of such States;
       And whereas, A Convention of delegates from the following States, viz:  South
  Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, met at
  Montgomery aforesaid, and on the eleventh day of March, Anno Domini 1861, agreed upon
  and reported to the Convention of the several States, therein represented, a Constitution for
  the Confederate States of America;
       Nor be it known, That we, the delegates, of the people of the State of Florida in
  Convention assembled, in the name and in behalf of the people of the State, having maturely
  deliberated and fully considered the aforesaid proposed Constitution, do by these presents,
  assent to and ratify the Constitution adopted by the Congress of States aforesaid on the 11th
  day of March, Anno Domini 1861, at Montgomery, in the State of Alabama, for the
  Government of the Confederate States of America; Declaring, nevertheless, That as the
  powers conferred through said Constitution on the Confederate Government emanate from
  the people of the several States in their separate sovereign capacity, said powers may be
  resumed in the same manner in which they are delegated, whenever they shall be perverted
  to the injury of the people, each State, by her delegates in Convention, having the right to
  judge of the occasion that may require such action; and hereby announcing to all those
  whom it may concern that the said Constitution is binding on the people of the State of
