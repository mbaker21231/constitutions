*** SSTART 001.00 9001.0 DE 1831 ***

We, the people, hereby ordain and establish this constitution of government for the State of Delaware.

Through divine goodness all men have, by nature, the rights of worshipping and serving their Creator
according to the dictates of their consciences; of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring
and protecting reputation and property, and, in general, of attaining objects suitable to their condition,
without injury by one to another; and as these rights are essential to their welfare, for the due exercise
thereof, power is inherent in them; and therefore all just authority in the institutions of political society is
derived from the people, and established with their consent, to advance their happiness. And they may
for this end, as circumstances require, from time to time, alter their constitution. of government.
