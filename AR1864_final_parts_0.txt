CONSTITUTION OF ARKANSAS-1864 

We, the people of the State of Arkansas, having the right to establish for ourselves a Constitution
in conformity with the Constitution of the United States of America, recognizing the legitimate
consequences of the existing rebellion, do hereby declare the entire action of the late convention
of the State of Arkansas, which assembled in the city of Little Rock, on the fourth day of March,
one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, was, and is, null and void, and is not now, and never
has been binding and obligatory upon the people.
That all the action of the State of Arkansas under the authority of said convention, of its
ordinances, or of its constitution, whether legislative, executive, judicial or military (except as
hereinafter provided,) was, and is hereby declared null and void; Provided, That this ordinance
shall not be so construed as to affect the rights of individuals, or change county boundaries, or
county seats, or to make invalid the acts of justices of the peace, or other officers in their
authority to administer oaths, or take and certify the acknowledgment of deeds of conveyance or
other instruments of writing, or in the solemnization of marriages: And provided further, That no
debt or liability of the State of Arkansas incurred by the action of said convention, or of the
legislature or any department of the government under the authority of either, shall ever be
recognized as obligatory.
And we, the people of the State of Arkansas, in order to establish therein a State government,
loyal to the Government of the United States-to secure to ourselves and our posterity, the
protection and blessings of the Federal Constitution, and the enjoyment of all the rights of liberty
and the free pursuit of happiness, do agree to continue ourselves as a free and independent State,
by the name and style of "the State of Arkansas," and do ordain and establish the following
Constitution for the government thereof:
