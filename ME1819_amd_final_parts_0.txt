twenty
or more, shall be entitled to vote wherever they may be. The three ranking officers of such

notice
and sufficient time shall be given for all voters in the regiment, battalion, battery, detachment,
company,
or part, of either, as the case may be, to vote. Regimental and field officers shall be entitled to
vote with
their respective commands. When not in actual command, such officers and also all general and
staff
officers, and all surgeons, assistant surgeons, and chaplains, shall be entitled to vote at any place
where
polls are opened. The supervisors of elections shall prepare a ballot-box or other suitable
receptacle for
the ballots. Upon one side of every ballot shall be printed or written the name of the county, and
also of
the city, town, or plantation in this State in which is the residence of the person proposing to
vote. Upon
the other side shall be the .name or names of the persons to be voted for, and the office or offices
which
he or they are intended to fill. And before receiving any vote, the supervisors, or a majority of
them,

a
residence in the county, city, town or plantation which is printed or written on the vote offered by
him.
If his right to vote is challenged, they may require him to make true answers, upon oath, to all
interrogatories touching his age, citizenship residence and right to vote, and shall hear any other
evidence offered by him, or by those who challenge his right. They shall keep correct poll-lists of
the
names of all persons allowed to vote, and of their respective places of residence in this State, and
also
the number of the regiment and company or battery to which they belong ; which lists shall be
certified
by them, or by a majority of them, to be correct, and that such residence is in accordance with the
indorsement of the residence of each voter on his vote. They shall check the name of every
person
before be is allowed to vote, and the check-mark shall be plainly made against his name on the
poll-
lists. They shall sort, count, and publicly declare the votes at the head of their respective
commands on
the day of election, unless prevented by the public enemy, and in that case as soon thereafter as
may
be; and on the same day of said declaration they shall form a list of the persons voted for, with
the
number of votes for each person against his name, and the office which he was intended to fill,
and shall
sign and seal up such list and cause the same, together with the poll-lists aforesaid, to be

in
such military service, shall be entitled to vote as aforesaid; and he shall be considered as voting
in the
city, town, plantation, and county in this State where he resided when he entered the service. The

or more, shall be entitled to vote wherever they may be. The three ranking officers of such
regiment,
battalion, battery, company, or part of either, as the case may be, acting as such on the day of

refuse to
act, the next in rank shall take his place. In case there are no officers or non-commissioned
officers
present, or if they or either of them refuse to act, the electors present, not less than twenty, may
choose,
by written ballot, enough of their own number, not exceeding three, to fill the vacancies, and the
persons so chosen shall be supervisors 'of elections. All supervisors shall be first sworn to
support the
Constitution of the United States and of this State, and faithfully and impartially to perform the
duties of
supervisors of elections. Each is authorized to administer the necessary oath to the others; and
certificates thereof shall be annexed to the list of votes by them to be made and returned into the
office
of the secretary of state of this State as hereinafter provided. The polls shall be opened and closed
at
such hours as the supervisors, or a majority of them, shall direct: Provided, however, That due
notice
and sufficient time shall be given for all voters in the regiment, battalion, battery, detachment,
company,
or part, of either, as the case may be, to vote. Regimental and field officers shall be entitled to
vote with
their respective commands. When not in actual command, such officers and also all general and
staff
officers, and all surgeons, assistant surgeons, and chaplains, shall be entitled to vote at any place
where
polls are opened. The supervisors of elections shall prepare a ballot-box or other suitable
receptacle for
the ballots. Upon one side of every ballot shall be printed or written the name of the county, and
also of
the city, town, or plantation in this State in which is the residence of the person proposing to
vote. Upon
the other side shall be the .name or names of the persons to be voted for, and the office or offices
which
he or they are intended to fill. And before receiving any vote, the supervisors, or a majority of
them,
must be satisfied of the age and citizenship of the person claiming to vote, and that he has in fact
a
residence in the county, city, town or plantation which is printed or written on the vote offered by
him.
If his right to vote is challenged, they may require him to make true answers, upon oath, to all
interrogatories touching his age, citizenship residence and right to vote, and shall hear any other
evidence offered by him, or by those who challenge his right. They shall keep correct poll-lists of
the
names of all persons allowed to vote, and of their respective places of residence in this State, and
also
the number of the regiment and company or battery to which they belong ; which lists shall be
certified
by them, or by a majority of them, to be correct, and that such residence is in accordance with the
indorsement of the residence of each voter on his vote. They shall check the name of every
person
before be is allowed to vote, and the check-mark shall be plainly made against his name on the
poll-
lists. They shall sort, count, and publicly declare the votes at the head of their respective
commands on
the day of election, unless prevented by the public enemy, and in that case as soon thereafter as
may
be; and on the same day of said declaration they shall form a list of the persons voted for, with
the
number of votes for each person against his name, and the office which he was intended to fill,
and shall
sign and seal up such list and cause the same, together with the poll-lists aforesaid, to be
delivered into
the office of the secretary of state aforesaid, on or before the first day of December, in the year
one
thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and on or before the fifteenth day of November biennially
thereafter forever. The  legislature of this State may pass any law additional to the foregoing

3. Apportionment of Representatives within each county shall be made by dividing the total

determine a

which

class
districts in number equal to the remainder of county Representatives unallocated under the
foregoing
procedure by grouping whole cities, towns and plantations as equitably as possible with
consideration
for population and for geographical contiguity. Provided, however, that no such representative
district
shall contain fewer inhabitants than the largest fraction remaining to any city or town within such
county
after the allocating of one or more Representatives under the foregoing procedure; and, provided
further, that additional Representatives, drawn from the remainder of county Representatives
unallocated under the foregoing procedure, shall be allocated to cities or towns having the largest
fraction remaining after the allocation of one or more Representatives under the foregoing
procedure if
such be necessary to insure that no such representative district contain fewer inhabitants than the
largest
fraction remaining to any city or town within such county after the allocating of one or more
Representatives under the foregoing procedure. Cities and towns entitled to two or more
Representatives under the foregoing procedure may, by affirmative vote of two-thirds of both
Houses
of the Legislature, be organized into single member districts whereby each legally qualified
elector
therein is entitled to vote for only one Representative, provided that all such        cities and towns
are so
organized.  In the event that the Legislature shall fail to make an apportionment, the Supreme
Judicial
Court shall, within sixty days following the end of the period in which the Legislature is required
to act,
but fails to do so, make the apportionment.
