School, and any others of like kind which may be hereafter organized or established by the state
of Mississippi, shall be under the management and control of a board of trustees to be known as
the board of trustees of state institutions of higher learning, the members thereof to be appointed
by the governor of the state with the advice and consent of the senate.  The governor shall
appoint only men or women as such members as shall be qualified electors residing in the district
from which each is appointed, and at least twenty-five years of age, and of the highest order of
intelligence, character, learning, and fitness for the performance of such duties, to the end that
such board shall perform the high and honorable duties thereof to the greatest advantage of the
people of the state of such educational institutions, uninfluenced by any political considerations. 
There shall be appointed one member of such board from each congressional district of the state
as now existing, and one member from each supreme court district, and two members shall be
appointed from the state at large.  The term of office of said trustees herein provided for shall
begin May 8, 1944; and it shall be the duty of the governor to make such appointments during the
regular session of the legislature of Mississippi in 1944; and one-third of the membership of said
board shall be appointed for a period of four years; one-third for a period of eight years; and one-
third for a period of twelve years; and thereafter their successors shall hold office for a period of
twelve years.  The members of the board of trustees as constituted at the time this amendment
shall be inserted in the constitution as a part thereof shall continue to hold office until their
respective terms expire under existing law, after which time the membership of the board shall
consist of the number hereinabove provided for.  In case of a vacancy on said board by death or
resignation of a member, or from any other cause than the expiration of such member's term of
office, the board shall elect his successor, who shall hold office until the end of the next session
of the legislature.  During such term of the session of the legislature the governor shall appoint
the successor member of the board from the district from which is predecessor was appointed, to
hold office until the end of the period, for which such original trustee was appointed, to the end
of the period for which such original trustee was appointed, to the end that one-third of such
trustee's terms will expire each four years.

One trustee in addition to the above shall be appointed by the governor for the University of
Mississippi, who shall have a vote only in matters pertaining to the University, and which trustee
shall be a resident citizen of DeSoto county, to be known as the trustee for the La Bauve fund,
and serve for a term of four years to commence from the date of appointment.

Such board shall have the power and authority to elect the heads of the various institutions of
higher learning, and contract with all deans, professors and other members of the teaching staff,
and all administrative employees of said institutions for a term not exceeding four years; but said
board shall have the power and authority to terminate any such contract at any time for
malfeasance, inefficiency or contumacious conduct, but never for political reason.

Nothing herein contained shall in any way limit or take away the power of the legislature had and
possessed, if any, at the time of the adoption of this amendment, to consolidate or abolish any of
the above named institutions.

Section 29.  (1) Excessive bail shall not be required, and all persons shall, before conviction, be
bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses (a) when the proof is evident or
presumption great; or (b) when the person previously has been convicted of a capital offense or
any other offense punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of twenty (20) years or more.

(2) If a person charged with committing any offense that is punishable by death, life
imprisonment or imprisonment for one (1) year or more in the penitentiary or any other state
correctional facility is granted bail and (a) if that person is indicted for a felony committed while
on bail; or (b) if the court, upon hearing, finds probable cause that the person has committed a
felony while on bail, then the court shall revoke bail and shall order that the person be detained,
without further bail, pending trial of the charge for which bail was revoked.  For the purposes of
this subsection (2) only, the term "felony" means any offense punishable by death, life
imprisonment or imprisonment for more than five (5) years under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which the crime is committed.  In addition, grand larceny shall be considered a felony for the
purposes of this subsection.

(3) In the case of offenses punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of twenty (20) years or
more or by life imprisonment, a county or circuit court judge may deny bail for such offenses
when the proof is evident or the presumption great upon making a determination that the release
of the person or persons arrested for such offenses would constitute a special danger to any other
person or to the community or that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably
assure the appearance of the person as required.

*** MSTART 137 029.4 003.0 0 MS 1890 1995 ***

(4) In any case where bail is denied before conviction, the judge shall place in the record his
reasons for denying bail.  Any person who is charged with an offense punishable by
imprisonment for a maximum of twenty (20) years or more or by life imprisonment and who is
denied bail prior to conviction shall be entitled to an emergency hearing before a justice of the
Mississippi Supreme Court.  The provisions of this subsection (4) do not apply to bail revocation
orders.

(1) Amendments to this Constitution may be proposed by the Legislature or by initiative of the
people.

*** MSTART 139 273.2 015.0 0 MS 1890 1998 ***

(2) Whenever two-thirds (2/3) of each house of the Legislature, which two-thirds (2/3) shall
consist of not less than a majority of the members elected to each house, shall deem any change,
alteration or amendment necessary to this Constitution, such proposed amendment, change or
alteration shall be read and passed by two-thirds (2/3) vote of each house, as herein provided;
public notice shall then be given by the Secretary of State at least thirty (30) days preceding an
election, at which the qualified electors shall vote directly for or against such change, alteration
or amendment, and if more than one (1) amendment shall be submitted at one (1) time, they shall
be submitted in such manner and form that the people may vote for or against each amendment
separately; and, notwithstanding the division of the Constitution into sections, the Legislature
may provide in its resolution for one or more amendments pertaining and relating to the same
subject or subject matter, and may provide for one or more amendments to an article of the
Constitution pertaining and relating to the same subject or subject matter, which may be included
and voted on as one (1) amendment; and if it shall appear that a majority of the qualified electors
voting directly for or against the same shall have voted for the proposed change, alteration or
amendment, then it shall be inserted as a part of the Constitution by proclamation of the
Secretary of State certifying that it received the majority vote required by the Constitution; and
the resolution may fix the date and direct the calling of elections for the purposes hereof.

(3) The people reserve unto themselves the power to propose and enact constitutional
amendments by initiative.  An initiative to amend the Constitution may be proposed by a petition
signed over a twelve-month period by qualified electors equal in number to at least twelve
percent (12%) of the votes for all candidates for Governor in the last gubernatorial election.  The
signatures of the qualified electors from any congressional district shall not exceed one-fifth (1/5)
of the total number of signatures required to qualify an initiative petition for placement upon the
ballot.  If an initiative petition contains signatures from a single congressional district which
exceed one-fifth (1/5) of the total number of required signatures, the excess number of signatures
from that congressional district shall not be considered by the Secretary of State in determining
whether the petition qualifies for placement on the ballot.

(4) The sponsor of an initiative shall identify in the text of the initiative the amount and source of
revenue required to implement the initiative.  If the initiative requires a reduction in any source
of government revenue, or a reallocation of funding from currently funded programs, the sponsor
shall identify in the text of the initiative the program or programs whose funding must be reduced
or eliminated to implement the initiative.  Compliance with this requirement shall not be a
violation of the subject matter requirements of this section of the Constitution.

(5) The initiative process shall not be used:

(a) For the proposal, modification or repeal of any portion of the Bill of Rights of the
Constitution;

(b) To amend or repeal any law or any provision of the Constitution relating to the Mississippi
Public Employees' Retirement System;

(c) To amend or repeal the constitutional guarantee that the right of any person to work shall not
be denied or abridged on account of membership or nonmembership in any labor union or
organization; or

(d) To modify the initiative process for proposing amendments to this Constitution.

(6) The Secretary of State shall file with the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate
the complete text of the certified initiative on the first day of the regular session.  A constitutional
initiative may be adopted by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature.  If the initiative is
adopted, amended or rejected by the Legislature; or of no action is taken within four (4) months
of the date that the initiative is filed with the Legislature, the Secretary of State shall place the
initiative on the ballot for the next statewide general election.

The chief legislative budget officer shall prepare a fiscal analysis of each initiative and each
legislative alternative.  A summary of each fiscal analysis shall appear on the ballot.

(7) If the Legislature amends an initiative, the amended version and the original initiative shall be
submitted to the electors.  An initiative or legislative alternative must receive a majority of the
votes thereon and not less than forty percent (40%) of the total votes cast at the election at which
the measure was submitted to be approved.  If conflicting initiatives or legislative alternatives are
approved at the same election, the initiative or legislative alternative receiving the highest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail.

(8) If an initiative measure proposed to the Legislature has been rejected by the Legislature and
an alternative measure is passed by the Legislature in lieu thereof, the ballot titles of both such
measures shall be so printed on the official ballots that a voter can express separately two (2)
preferences: First, by voting for the approval of either measure or against both measures, and
secondly, by voting for one measure or the other measure.  If the majority of those voting on the
first issue is against both measures, then both measures fail, but in that case the votes on the
second issue nevertheless shall be carefully counted and made public.  If a majority voting on the
first issue is for the approval of either measure, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes
on the second issue and also receiving not less than forty percent (40%) of the total votes cast at
the election at which the measure was submitted for approval shall be law.  Any person who
votes for the ratification of either measure on the first issue must vote for one (1) of the measures
on the second issue in order for the ballot to be valid.  Any person who votes against both
measures on the first issue may vote but shall not be required to vote for any of the measures on
the second issue in order for the ballot to be valid.  Substantially the following form shall be a
compliance with this subsection:

             INITIATED BY PETITION AND ALTERNATIVE
                         BY LEGISLATURE

(9) No more than five (5) initiative proposals shall be submitted to the voters on a single ballot,
and the first five (5) initiative proposals to the Secretary of State with sufficient petitions shall be
the proposals which are submitted to the voters.  The sufficiency of petitions shall be decided on
the first instance by the Secretary of State, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the state,
which shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all such cases.

(11) If any amendment to the Constitution proposed by initiative petition is rejected by a majority
of the qualified electors voting thereon, no initiative petition proposing the same, or substantially
the same, amendment shall be submitted to the electors for at least two (2) years after the date of
the election on such amendment.

*** MSTART 149 273.12 015.0 0 MS 1890 1998 ***

(12) The Legislature shall provide by the law the manner in which initiative petitions shall be
circulated, presented and certified.  To prevent signature fraud and to maintain the integrity of the
initiative process the state has a compelling interest in insuring that no person shall circulate an
initiative petition or obtain signatures on an initiative petition unless the person is a resident of
this state at the time of circulation.  For the purposes of this subsection the term "resident" means
a person who is domiciled in Mississippi as evidenced by an intent to maintain a principal
dwelling place in Mississippi indefinitely and to return to Mississippi if temporarily absent,
coupled with an act or acts consistent with that intent.  Every person who circulates an initiative
petition shall print and sign his name on each page of an initiative petition, or on a separate page
attached to each page, certifying that he was a resident of this state at the time of circulating the
petition.  The Secretary of State shall refuse to accept for filing any page of an initiative petition
upon which the signatures appearing thereon were obtained by a person who was not a resident
of this state at the time of circulating the petition, and an initiative measure shall not be placed on
the ballot if the Secretary of State determines that without such signatures the petition clearly
bears an insufficient number of signatures.  The provisions of this subsection (12) shall be
applicable to all initiative measures that have not been placed on the ballot at the time this
proposed amendment is ratified by the electorate.

restrict or impair the provisions of this section or the powers herein reserved to the people.

(1) Victims of crime, as defined by law, shall have the right to be treated with fairness, dignity
and respect throughout the criminal justice process; and to be informed, to be present and to be
heard, when authorized by law, during public hearings.

(2) Nothing in this section shall provide grounds for the accused or convicted to obtain any form
of relief nor shall this section impair the constitutional rights of the accused.  Nothing in this
section or any enabling statute shall be construed as creating a cause of action for damages
against the state or any of its agencies, officials, employees or political subdivisions.

(3) The Legislature shall have the authority to enact substantive and procedural laws to define,
implement, preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to victims by this section.
