CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH CAROLINA-1776 

Whereas the British Parliament, claiming of late years a right to bind the North American
colonies by law in all cases whatsoever, have enacted statutes for raising a revenue in those
colonies and disposing of such revenue as they thought proper, without the consent and against
the will of the colonists. And whereas it appearing to them that (they not being represented in
Parliament) such claim was altogether unconstitutional, and, if admitted, would at once reduce
them from the rank of freemen to a state of the most abject slavery; the said colonies, therefore,
severally remonstrated against the passing, and petitioned for the repeal, of those acts, but in
vain; and whereas the said claim being persisted in, other unconstitutional and oppressive statutes
have been since enacted by which the powers of admiralty courts in the colonies are extended
beyond their ancient limits, and jurisdiction is given to such courts in cases similar to those
which in Great Britain are triable by jury; persons are liable to be sent to and tried in Great
Britain for an offence created and made capital by one of those statutes, though committed in the
colonies; the harbor of Boston was blocked up; people indicted for murder in the Massachusetts
Bay may, at the will, of a governor, be sent for trial to any other colony, or even to Great Britain;
the chartered constitution of government in that colony is materially altered; the English laws and
a free government, to which the inhabitants of Quebec were entitled by the King's royal
proclamation, are abolished and French laws are restored; the Roman Catholic religion (although
before tolerated and freely exercised there) and an absolute government are established in that
province, and its limits extended through a vast tract of country so as to border on the free
Protestant English settlements, with design of using a whole people differing in religious
principles from the neighboring colonies, and subject to arbitrary power, as fit instruments to
overawe and subdue the colonies. And whereas the delegates of all the colonies on this continent,
from Nova Scotia to Georgia, assembled in a general Congress at Philadelphia, in the most
dutiful manner laid their complaints at the foot of the throne, and humbly implored their Sov-

ereign that his royal authority and interposition might be used for their relief from the grievances
occasioned by those statutes, and assured His Majesty that harmony between Great Britain and
America, ardently desired by the latter, would be thereby immediately restored and that the
colonists confided in the magnanimity and justice of the King and Parliament for redress of the
many other grievances under which they labored. And whereas these complaints being wholly
disregarded, statutes still more cruel than those above mentioned have been enacted, prohibiting
the intercourse of the colonies with each other, restricting their trade, and depriving many
thousands of people of the means of subsistence, by restraining them from fishing on the
American coast. And whereas large fleets and marines having been sent to America in order to
enforce the execution of those laws, and to compel, in absolute and implicit submission to the
will of a corrupt and despotic administration, and in consequence thereof, hostilities having been
commenced in the Massachusetts Bay, by the troops under command of General Gage, whereby a
number of peaceable, helpless, and unarmed people were wantonly robbed and murdered, and
there being just reason to apprehend that like hostilities would be committed in all the other
colonies. The colonists were therefore, driven to the necessity of taking up arms, to repel force by
force, and to defend themselves and their properties against lawless invasions and. depredations.
Nevertheless, the delegates of the said colonies assembled in another Congress at Philadelphia,
anxious to procure a reconciliation with Great Britain upon just and constitutional principles,
supplicated His Majesty to direct some mode by which the united applications of his faithful
colonists might be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation, that in the mean time
measures might be taken for preventing the further destruction of their lives, and that such
statutes as immediately distressed any of the colonists might be repealed. And whereas, instead
of obtaining that justice, to which the colonists were and are of right entitled, the unnatural civil
war into which they were thus precipitated and are involved, hath been prosecuted with
unremitted violence, and the governors and others bearing the royal commission in the colonies
having broken the most solemn promises and engagements, and violated every obligation of
honor, justice, and humanity, have caused the persons of divers good people to be seized and
imprisoned, and their properties to be forcibly taken and detained or destroyed, without any
crime or forfeiture; excited domestic insurrections; proclaimed freedom to servants and slaves,
enticed or stolen them from, and armed them against their masters; instigated and encouraged the
Indian nations to war against the colonies; dispensed with the law of the land, and substituted the
law martial in its stead; killed many of the colonists; burned several towns, and threatened to
burn the rest, and daily endeavor by a conduct which has sullied the British arms, and would
disgrace even savage nations, to effect the ruin and destruction of the colonies; and whereas a
statute hath been lately passed, whereby, under pretence that the said colonies are in open
rebellion, all trade and commerce whatsoever with them is prohibited; vessels belonging to their
inhabitants trading in, to, or from the said colonies, with the cargoes and effects on board such
vessels, are made lawful prize, and the masters and crews of such vessels are subjected by force
to act on board the King's ships against their country and dearest friends; and all seizures and
detention or destruction of the persons and properties of the colonists which have at any time
been made or committed for withstanding or suppressing the said pretended rebellion, and which
shall be made in pursuance of the said act, or for the service of the public, are justified, and
persons suing for damages in such cases are, on failing in their suits, subjected to payment of
very heavy expenses. And whereas large reenforcements of troops and ship have been ordered 
and are daily expected in America for carrying on war against each of the united colonies by the
most vigorous exertions. And whereas in consequence of a plan recommended by the governors,
and which seems to have been concerted between them and their ministerial masters to withdraw
the usual officers and thereby loosen the bands of government and create anarchy and confusion
in the colonies. Lord William Campbell, late governor, on the fifteenth day of September last,
dissolved the general assembly of this colony and no other hath been since called, although by
law the sitting and holding of general assemblies cannot be intermitted above six months, and
having used his utmost efforts to destroy the lives, liberties, and properties of the good people
here, whom by the duty of his station he was bound to protect, withdrew himself from the colony
and carried off the great seal and the royal instructions to governors. And whereas the judges of
courts of law here have refused to exercise their respective functions, so that it is become
indispensably necessary that during the present situation of American affairs, and until an
accommodation of the unhappy differences between Great Britain and America can be obtained,
(an event which, though traduced and treated as rebels, we still earnestly desire,) some mode
should be established by common consent, and for the good of the people, the origin and end of
all governments, for regulating the internal polity of this colony. The congress being vested with
powers competent for the purpose, and having fully deliberated touching the premises, do
therefore resolve:
