  There shall not be on said board more than one graduate of any one of the institutions
under the jurisdiction of the state board of higher education at any one time.  No person
employed by any institution under the control of the board shall serve as a member of the board,
nor shall any employee of any such institution be eligible for membership on the state board of
higher education for a period of two years following the termination of his employment.
  On or before the first day of February, 1939, the governor shall nominate from a list of
three names for each position, selected by the unanimous action of the president of the North
Dakota education association, the chief justice of the supreme court, and the
superintendent of public instruction, and, with the consent of a majority of the members-elect of
the senate, shall appoint from such list as such state board of higher education seven members,
whose terms shall commence on the first day of July, 1939, one of which terms shall expire on
the thirtieth day of June in each of the years 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, and 1946.  The term
of office of members appointed to fill vacancies at the
expiration of said terms shall be for seven years, and in the case of vacancies otherwise arising,
appointments shall be made only for the balance of the term of the members whose places are to
be filled. 
b. In the event any nomination made by the governor is not consented to and
confirmed by the senate as hereinbefore provided, the governor shall again nominate a candidate
for such office, selected from a new list, prepared in the manner hereinbefore provided, which
nomination shall be submitted to the senate for confirmation, and said proceedings shall be
continued until such appointments have been confirmed by the senate, or the session of the
legislature shall have adjourned.
c. When any term expires or a vacancy occurs when the legislature is not in session, the
governor may appoint from a list selected as hereinbefore provided, a member who shall
serve until the opening of the next session of the legislature, at which time his appointment shall
be certified to the senate for confirmation, as above provided; and if the appointment be not
confirmed by the thirtieth legislative day of such session, his office shall be deemed vacant and
the governor shall nominate from a list selected as hereinbefore provided, another candidate for
such office and the same proceedings shall be followed as are above set forth; provided further,
that when the legislature shall be in session at any time within six months prior to the date of the
expiration of the term of any member, the governor shall nominate his successor from a list
selected as above set forth, within the first thirty days of such session, and upon confirmation by
the senate such successor shall take office at the expiration of the term of the incumbent. No
person who has been nominated and whose nomination the senate has failed to confirm is
eligible for an interim appointment. 

3. The members of the state board of higher education may only be removed by impeachment for
the offenses and in the manner and according to the procedure provided for the removal of the

devoted to the duties of his office, and in addition, shall receive his necessary expenses in the
same manner and amounts as other state officials for attending meetings and performing other
functions of his office.

5. The legislature shall provide adequate funds for the proper carrying out of the
functions and duties of the state board of higher education.

6. a. The state board of higher education shall hold its first meeting at the office of the state board
of administration at Bismarck, on the 6th day of July, 1939, and shall organize and elect one of
its members as president of such board for a term of one year. It shall also at said meeting, or as
soon thereafter as may be practicable, elect a competent person as secretary, who shall reside
during his term of office in the city of Bismarck, North Dakota. Said secretary shall hold office at
the will of the board. As soon as said board is established and organized, it shall assume all the
powers and perform all the duties now conferred by law upon the board of administration in
connection with the several institutions hereinbefore mentioned, and the said board of
administration shall immediately upon the organization of said state board of higher education,
surrender and transfer to said state board of higher education all duties, rights, and powers
granted to it under the existing laws of this state concerning the institutions hereinbefore
mentioned, together with all property, deeds, records, reports, and appurtenances of every kind
belonging or appertaining to said institutions.
b. The said state board of higher education shall have full authority over the institutions under its
control with the right, among its other powers, to prescribe, limit, or modify the courses offered
at the several institutions. In furtherance of its powers, the state board of higher education shall
have the power to delegate to its employees details of the administration of the institutions under
its control. The said state board of higher education shall have full authority to organize or
reorganize within constitutional and statutory limitations, the work of each institution under its
control, and do each and everything necessary and proper for the efficient and economic
administration of said state educational institutions.
c. Said board shall prescribe for all of said institutions standard systems of accounts and records
and shall biennially, and within six (6) months immediately preceding the regular session of the
legislature, make a report to the governor, covering in detail the operations of the educational
institutions under its control.

submit the budget requests for the biennial appropriations for said institutions to said state board
of higher education; and said state board of higher education shall consider said budgets and shall
revise the same as in its judgment shall be for the best interests of the educational system of the
state; and thereafter the state board of higher education shall prepare and present to the state
budget board and to the legislature a single unified budget covering the needs of all the
institutions under its control. "Said budget shall be prepared and presented by the board of
administration until the state board of higher education organizes as provided in subsection 6a."
The appropriations for all of said institutions shall be contained in one legislative measure. The
budgets and appropriation measures for the agricultural experiment stations and their substations
and the extension division of the North Dakota state university of agriculture and applied science
may be separate from those of state educational institutions.
e. The said state board of higher education shall have the control of the expenditure of the funds
belonging to, and allocated to such institutions and also those appropriated by the legislature, for
the institutions of higher education in this state; provided, however, that funds appropriated by
the legislature and specifically designated for any one or more of such institutions, shall not be
used for any other institution.

7. a. The state board of higher education shall, as soon as practicable, appoint for a
term of not to exceed three (3) years, a state commissioner of higher education, whose principal
office shall be at the state capitol, in the city of Bismarck. Said commissioner of higher education
shall be responsible to the state board of higher education and shall be removable by said board
for cause.
b. The state commissioner of higher education shall be a graduate of some reputable college or
university, and who by training and experience is familiar with the problems peculiar to higher
education.
c. Such commissioner of higher education shall be the chief executive officer of said state board
of higher education, and shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed by the board.

8. This constitutional provision shall be self-executing and shall become effective without the
necessity of legislative action.

purchaser or his heirs or assigns is unable to pay in full for the land purchased within twenty
years after the date of purchase and such contract is in default and subject to being declared null
and void as by law provided, the board of university and school lands may, after declaring such
contract null and void, resell the land described in such contract to such purchaser, his heirs or
assigns, for the amount of the unpaid principal, together with interest thereon reckoned to the
date of such resale at the rate of not less than three (3%) percent, but in no case shall the resale
price be more than the original sale price; such contract of resale shall be upon the terms herein

2. The state may issue general obligation bonds for this purpose to an amount which, with all
outstanding general obligation bonds, less the amount of all money on hand and taxes in process
of collection which are appropriated for their payment, will not exceed five percent of the full

of Congress; that the lands belonging to citizens of the United States residing without this state
shall never be taxed at a higher rate than the lands belonging to residents of this state; that no

who has severed his tribal relations, and has obtained from the United States or from any person,
a title thereto, by patent or other grant, save and except such lands as have been or may be
granted to any Indian or Indians under any acts of congress containing a provision exempting the
lands thus granted from taxation, which last mentioned lands shall be exempt from taxation so
long, and to such an extent, as is, or may be provided in the act of congress granting the same.
3.  In order that payment of the debts and liabilities contracted or incurred by and on behalf of the
Territory of Dakota may be justly and equitably provided for and made, and in pursuance of the
requirements of an act of congress approved February 22, 1889, entitled "An act to provide for
the division of Dakota into two states and to enable the people of North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana and Washington to form constitutions and state governments and to be admitted into
the union on an equal footing with the original states, and to make donations of public lands to
such states," the states of North Dakota and South Dakota, by proceedings of a joint commission,
duly appointed under said act the sessions whereof were held at Bismarck in said State of North
Dakota, from July 16, 1889, to July 31, 1889, inclusive, have agreed to the following adjustment
of the amounts of the debts and liabilities of the Territory of Dakota which shall be assumed and
paid by each of the States of North Dakota and South Dakota, respectively, to wit:
  This agreement shall take effect and be in force from and after the admission into the union, as
one of the United States of America, of either the State of North Dakota or the State of South
Dakota.
  The words "State of North Dakota," wherever used in this agreement, shall be taken to mean
the Territory of North Dakota in case the State of South Dakota shall be admitted into the union
prior to the admission into the union of the State of North Dakota; and the words "State of South
Dakota," wherever used in this agreement, shall be taken to mean the Territory of South Dakota
in case the State of North Dakota shall be admitted into the union prior to the admission into the
union of the State of South Dakota.
     The said State of North Dakota shall assume and pay all bonds issued by the Territory of
Dakota to provide funds for the purchase, constitution, repairs or maintenance of such public
institutions, grounds or buildings as are located within the boundaries of North Dakota, and shall
pay all warrants issued under and by virtue of that certain act of the legislative assembly of the
Territory of Dakota, approved March 8, 1889, entitled "An act to provide for the refunding of
outstanding warrants drawn on the capitol building fund."
    The said State of South Dakota shall assume and pay all bonds issued by the Territory of
Dakota to provide funds for the purchase, construction, repairs or maintenance of such public
institutions, grounds or buildings as are located within the boundaries of South Dakota.  That is
to say: the State of North Dakota shall assume and pay the following bonds and indebtedness, to
wit:
  Bonds issued on account of the hospital for insane at Jamestown, North Dakota, the face
aggregate of which is $266,000; also, bonds issued on account of the North Dakota university at
Grand Forks, North Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $96,700; also, bonds issued on
account of the penitentiary at Bismarck, North Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $93,600;
also, refunding capitol building warrants dated April 1, 1889, $83,507.46.
  And the State of South Dakota shall assume and pay the following bonds and indebtedness, to
wit:
   Bonds issued on account of the hospital for the insane at Yankton, South Dakota, the face
aggregate of which is $210,000; also, bonds issued on account of the school for deaf mutes, at
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $51,000; also, bonds issued on account
of the university at Vermillion, South Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $75,600, also, bonds
issued on account of the penitentiary at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the face aggregate of which is
$94,306; also, bonds issued on account of the agricultural college at Brookings, South Dakota,
the face aggregate of which is $97,500; also, bonds issued on account of the normal school at
Madison, South Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $49,400; also, bonds issued on account of
the school of mines at Rapid City, South  Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $33,000; also,
bonds issued on account of the reform school at Plankinton, South Dakota, the face aggregate of
which is $30,000; also, bonds issued on account of the normal school at Spearfish, South Dakota,
the face aggregate of which is $25,000; also, bonds issued on account of the soldiers' home at
Hot Springs, South Dakota, the face aggregate of which is $45,000.
    The states of North Dakota and South Dakota shall pay one-half each of all liabilities now
existing or hereafter and prior to the taking effect of this agreement incurred, except those
heretofore or hereafter incurred, on account of public institutions, grounds or buildings, except as
otherwise herein specifically provided.

    The State of South Dakota shall pay to the State of North Dakota $46,500, on account of the
excess of territorial appropriations for the permanent improvement of territorial institutions
which under this agreement will go to South Dakota, and in full of the undivided one-half
interest of North Dakota in the territorial library, and in full settlement of unbalanced accounts,
and of all claims against the territory, of whatever nature, legal or equitable, arising out of the
alleged erroneous or unlawful taxation of Northern Pacific railroad lands, and the payment of
said amount shall discharge and exempt the State of South Dakota from all liability for or on
account of the several matters hereinbefore referred to; nor shall either state be called upon to pay
or answer to any portion of liability hereafter arising or accruing on account of transactions
heretofore had, which liability would be a liability of the Territory of Dakota had such territory
remained in existence, and which liability shall grow out of matters connected with any public
institutions, grounds or buildings of the territory situated or located within the boundaries of the
other state.
    A final adjustment adjustment of accounts shall be made upon the following basis: North
Dakota shall be charged with all sums paid on account of the public institutions, grounds or
buildings located within its boundaries on account of the current appropriations since March 9,
1889; and South Dakota shall be charged with all sums paid on account of public institutions,
grounds or buildings located within its boundaries on the same account and during the same time.
Each state shall be charged with one-half of all other expenses of the territorial government
during the same time. All moneys paid into the treasury during the period from March 8, 1889, to
the time of taking effect of this agreement by any county, municipality or person within the limits
of the proposed State of North Dakota, shall be credited to the State of North Dakota; and all
sums paid into said treasury within the same time by any county, municipality or person within
the limits of the proposed State of South Dakota shall be credited to the State of South Dakota;
except that any and all taxes on gross earnings paid into said treasury by railroad corporations,
since the 8th day of March, 1889, based upon earnings of years prior to 1888, under and by virtue
of the act of the legislative assembly of the Territory of Dakota, approved March 7, 1889, and
entitled "An act providing for the levy and collection of taxes upon property of railroad
companies in this Territory," being chapter 107 of the session laws of 1889 (that is, the part of
such sums going to the territory), shall be equally divided between the states of North Dakota and
South Dakota, and all taxes heretofore or hereafter paid into said treasury under and by virtue of
the act last mentioned, based on the gross earning of the year 1888, shall be distributed as already
provided by laws except that so much thereof as goes to the territorial treasury shall be divided as
follows: North Dakota shall have so much thereof as shall be or has been paid by railroads within
the limits of the proposed State of North Dakota, and South Dakota so much thereof as shall be
or has been paid by railroads within the limits of the proposed State of South Dakota; each state
shall be credited also with all balances of appropriations made by the seventeenth legislative
assembly of the Territory of Dakota for the account of the public institutions, grounds or
buildings situated within its limits, remaining unexpended on March 8, 1889. If there shall be any
indebtedness except the indebtedness represented by the bonds and refunding warrants
hereinbefore mentioned, each state shall at the time of such final adjustment of accounts, assume
its share of said indebtedness as determined by the amount paid on account of the public
institutions, grounds or buildings of such state in excess of the receipts from counties,
municipalities, railroad corporations or persons within the limits of said state, as provided in this
article; and if there should be a surplus at the time of such final adjustment, each state shall be
entitled to the amounts received from counties, municipalities, railroad corporations or persons
within its limits over and above the amount charged it. And the State of North Dakota hereby
obligates itself to pay such part of the debts and liabilities of the Territory of Dakota as is
declared by the foregoing agreement to be its proportion thereof, the same as if such proportion
had been originally created by said State of North Dakota as its own debt or liability.

who has been nominated and whose nomination the senate has failed to confirm is eligible for an
interim appointment.  On or before July first of each year, beginning in 1995, the governor shall
appoint a student member from a list of names recommended by the executive board of the North

its members as president of such board for a term of one year. It shall also at said meeting, or as
soon thereafter as may be practicable, elect a competent person as secretary, who shall reside
during his term of office in the city of Bismarck, North Dakota. Said secretary shall hold office at
the will of the board. As soon as said board is established and organized, it shall assume all the
powers and perform all the duties now conferred by law upon the board of administration in
connection with the several institutions hereinbefore mentioned, and the said board of
administration shall immediately upon the organization of said state board of higher education,

submit the budget requests for the biennial appropriations for said institutions to said state board
of higher education; and said state board of higher education shall consider said budgets and shall
revise the same as in its judgment shall be for the best interests of the educational system of the
state; and thereafter the state board of higher education shall prepare and present to the state
budget board and to the legislature a single unified budget covering the needs of all the
institutions under its control. "Said budget shall be prepared and presented by the board of
administration until the state board of higher education organizes as provided in subsection 6a."
The appropriations for all of said institutions shall be contained in one legislative measure. The
budgets and appropriation measures for the agricultural experiment stations and their substations
and the extension division of the North Dakota state university of agriculture and applied science
may be separate from those of state educational institutions.
e. The said state board of higher education shall have the control of the expenditure of the funds
belonging to, and allocated to such institutions and also those appropriated by the legislature, for
the institutions of higher education in this state; provided, however, that funds appropriated by
the legislature and specifically designated for any one or more of such institutions, shall not be
used for any other institution.

the board of university and school lands so determine, by it, be declared null and void. No
contract of sale heretofore made under the provisions of this section of the constitution as then
providing shall be affected by this amendment, except prepayment of principal may be made as
herein provided.
Any of said lands that may be required for townsite purposes, schoolhouse sites, church
sites, cemetery sites, sites for other educational or charitable institutions, public parks, airplane
landing fields, fairgrounds, public highways, railroad right of way, or other railroad uses and
purposes, reservoirs for the storage of water for irrigation, irrigation canals, and ditches, drainage

eminent domain under the constitution and laws of this state, may be sold under the provisions of
this article, and shall be paid for in full at the time of sale, or at any time thereafter as herein
provided. Any of said lands and any other lands controlled by the board of university and school
lands, including state coal mineral interests, may, with the approval of said board, be exchanged
for lands and coal mineral interests of the United States, the state of North Dakota or any county
or municipality thereof as the legislature may provide, and the lands so acquired shall be subject
to the trust to which the lands exchanged therefor were subject, and the state shall reserve all
mineral and water power rights in land so transferred, except coal mineral interests approved for
exchange by the board of university and school lands under this section.
When any of said lands have been heretofore or may be hereafter sold on contract, and the
purchaser or his heirs or assigns is unable to pay in full for the land purchased within twenty
years after the date of purchase and such contract is in default and subject to being declared null
and void as by law provided, the board of university and school lands may, after declaring such
contract null and void, resell the land described in such contract to such purchaser, his heirs or
assigns, for the amount of the unpaid principal, together with interest thereon reckoned to the
date of such resale at the rate of not less than three (3%) percent, but in no case shall the resale
price be more than the original sale price; such contract of resale shall be upon the terms herein
provided, provided this section shall be deemed self-executing insofar as the provisions for resale
herein made are concerned.
