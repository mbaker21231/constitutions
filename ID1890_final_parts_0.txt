  SEC. 12. Optional forms of county government. The legislature by general law may
  provide for optional forms of county government for counties, which shall be the exclusive
  optional forms of county government.  No optional form of county government shall be

  their present form of county government or adopt any of the optional forms of county

  not more frequently than each four years. When an optional form of county  government
  has been adopted, the provisions of this section supersede sections 5, 6 and 10 of this article

  SEC. 1. Limitation on public indebtedness.  The legislature shall not in any manner
  create any debt or debts, liability or liabilities, except in case of war, to repel an invasion, or
  suppress an insurrection, unless the same shall be authorized by law, for some single object
  or work, to be distinctly specified therein, which law shall provide ways and means,
  exclusive of loans, for the payment of the interest on such debt or liability as it falls due, and
  also for the payment and discharge of the principal of such debt or liability within twenty
  years of the time of the contracting thereof, and shall be irrepealable until the principal and
  interest thereon shall be paid and discharged. But no such law shall take effect until at a
  general election it shall have been submitted to the people, and shall have received a
  majority of all the votes cast for or against it at such election, and all moneys raised by the
  authority of such laws shall be applied only to specified objects therein stated or to the
  payment of the debt thereby created, and such law shall be published prior to the general
  election at which it is submitted to the people, in the same manner as amendments to this

  This section shall not apply to liabilities incurred for ordinary operating expenses,
  nor shall it apply to debts or liabilities that are repaid by the end of the fiscal year. The debts
