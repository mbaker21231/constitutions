bill.

STATE WIDE PETITIONS

Initiative - The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Eight percent of the legal
voters may propose any law and ten per cent may propose a Constitutional Amendment by
initiative petition, and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed.
Initiative petitions for State-wide measures shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than
four months before the election at which they are to be voted upon; provided, that at least thirty
days before the aforementioned filing, the proposed measure shall have been published once, at
the expense of the petitioners, in some paper of general circulation.

Referendum - The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and any number not
less than six per cent of the legal voters may, by petition, order the referendum against any
general act, or any item of an appropriation bill, or measure passed by the General Assembly, but
the filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of any such act or
measure shall not delay the remainder from becoming operative. Such petition shall be filed with
the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session at
which such act was passed, except when a recess or adjournment shall be taken temporarily for a
longer period than ninety days, in which case such petition shall be filed not later than ninety
days after such recess or temporary adjournment. Any measure referred to the people by
referendum petition shall remain in abeyance until such vote is taken. The total number of votes
cast for the office of Governor in the last preceding general election shall be the basis upon
which the number of signatures of legal voters upon State-wide initiative and referendum
petitions shall be computed.

Upon all initiative or referendum petitions provided for in any of the sections of this article, it
shall be necessary to file, from at least fifteen of the counties of the State, petitions bearing the
signature of not less than one-half of the designated percentage of the electors of such county.

Emergency - If it shall be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety
that a measure shall become effective without delay, such necessity shall be stated in one section,
and if upon a yea and nay vote two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, or two-thirds
of all the members elected to city or town councils, shall vote upon separate roll call in favor of
the measure going into immediate operation, such emergency measure shall become effective
without delay. It shall be necessary, however, to state the fact which constitutes such emergency.
Provided, however, that an emergency shall not be declared on any franchise or special privilege
or act creating any vested right or interest or alienating any property of the State. If a referendum
is filed against any emergency measure such measure shall be a law until it is voted upon by the
people, and if it is then rejected by a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall be thereby
repealed. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to city or town councils.

LOCAL PETITIONS

Municipalities and Counties - The initiative and referendum powers of the people are hereby
further reserved to the local voters of each municipality and county as to all local, special and
municipal legislation of every character in and for their respective municipalities and counties,
but no local legislation shall be enacted contrary to the Constitution or any general law of the
State, and any general law shall have the effect of repealing any local legislation which is in
conflict therewith.

Municipalities may provide for the exercise of the initiative and referendum as to their legal
legislation.

General laws shall be enacted providing for the exercise of the initiative and referendum as to
counties. Fifteen per cent of the legal voters of any municipality or county may order the
referendum, or invoke the initiative upon any local measures. In municipalities the number of
signatures required upon any petition shall be computed upon the total vote cast for the office of
mayor at the last preceding general election; in counties, upon the office of Circuit Clerk. In
municipalities and counties the time for filing an initiative petition shall not be fixed at less than
sixty days nor more than ninety days before the election at which it is to be voted upon; for a
referendum petition at not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days after the passage of
such measure by a municipal council; nor less than ninety days when filed against a local or
special measure passed by the General Assembly.

Every extension, enlargement, grant, or conveyance of a franchise or any rights, property,
easement, lease, or occupation of or in any road, street, alley or any part thereof in real property
or interest in real property owned by municipalities, exceeding in value three hundred dollars,
whether the same be by statute, ordinance, resolution, or otherwise, shall be subject to
referendum and shall not be subject to emergency legislation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Definition - The word "measure" as used herein includes any bill, law, resolution, ordinance,
charter, constitutional amendment or legislative proposal or enactment of any character.

No Veto - The veto power of the Governor or Mayor shall not extend to measures initiated by or
referred to the people.

Amendment and Repeal - No measure approved by a vote of the people shall be amended or
repealed by the General Assembly or by any City Council, except upon a yea and nay vote on roll
call of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house of the General Assembly, or of the
City Council, as the case may be.

Election - All measures initiated by the people, whether for the State, county, city or town, shall
be submitted only at the regular elections, either State, congressional or municipal, but
referendum petitions may be referred to the people at special elections to be called by the proper
official, and such special elections shall be called when fifteen per cent of the legal voters shall
petition for such special election, and if the referendum is invoked as to any measure passed by a
city or town council, such city or town council may order a special election.

Majority - Any measure submitted to the people as herein provided shall take effect and become
a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast upon such measure, and not otherwise, and
shall not be required to receive a majority of the electors voting at such elections. Such measures
shall be operative on and after the 30th day after the election at which it is approved, unless
otherwise specified in the act.

This section shall not be construed to deprive any member of the General Assembly of the right
to introduce any measure, but no measure shall be submitted to the people by the General
Assembly, except a proposed constitutional amendment or amendments as provided for in this
Constitution.

Canvass and Declaration of Result - The result of the vote upon any State measure shall be
canvassed and declared by the State Board of Election Commissioners (or legal substitute
therefor); upon a municipal or county measure, by the County Election Commissioners (or legal
substitute therefor).

Conflicting Measures - If conflicting measures initiated or referred to the people shall be
approved by a majority of the votes severally cast for and against the same at the same election,
the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall become law.

THE PETITION

Title - At the time of filing petitions the exact title to be used on the ballot shall by the petitioner
be submitted with the petition, and on State-wide measures, shall be submitted to the State Board
of Election Commissioners, who shall certify such title to the Secretary of State, to be placed
upon the ballot; on county and municipal measures such title shall be submitted to the County
Election Board and shall by said board be placed upon the ballot in such county or municipal
election.

Limitation - No limitation shall be placed upon the number of constitutional amendments, laws,
or other measures which may be proposed and submitted to the people by either initiative or
referendum petition as provided in this section. No petition shall be held invalid if it shall contain
a greater number of signatures than required herein.

Verification - Only legal votes shall be counted upon petitions. Petitions may be circulated and
presented in parts but each part of any petition shall have attached thereto, the affidavit of the
persons circulating the same, that all signatures thereon were made in the presence of the affiant,
and that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief each signature is genuine, and that the
person signing is a legal voter, and no other affidavit or verification shall be required to establish
the genuineness of such signatures.

Sufficiency - The sufficiency of all State-wide petitions shall be decided in the first instance by
the Secretary of State, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the State, which shall have
original and exclusive jurisdiction over all such causes. The sufficiency of all local petitions shall
be decided in the first instance by the county clerk or the city clerk, as the case may be, subject to
review by the Chancery Court.

Court Decisions - If the sufficiency of any petition is challenged such cause shall be a preference
cause and shall be tried at once, but the failure of the courts to decide prior to the election as to
the sufficiency of any such petition shall not prevent the question from being placed upon the
ballot at the election named in such petition, nor militate against the validity of such measure, if
it shall have been approved by a vote of the people.

Amendment of Petition - If the Secretary of State, county clerk or city clerk, as the case may be,
shall decide any petition to be insufficient, he shall without delay notify the sponsors of such
petition, and permit at least thirty days from the date of such notification, in the instance of a
State-wide petition, or ten days in the instance of a municipal or county petition, for correction or
amendment. In the event of legal proceedings to prevent giving legal effect to any petition upon
any grounds, the burden of proof shall be upon the person or persons attacking the validity of the
petition.

Unwarranted Restrictions Prohibited - No law shall be passed to prohibit any person or persons
from giving or receiving compensation for circulating petitions, nor to prohibit the circulation of
petitions, nor in any manner interfering with the freedom of the people in procuring petitions; but
laws shall be enacted prohibiting and penalizing perjury, forgery and all other felonies or other
fraudulent practices in the securing of signatures or filing of petitions.

Publication - All measures submitted to a vote of the people by petition under the provisions of
this section shall be published as is now, or hereafter may be provided by law.

Enacting Clause - The style of all the bills initiated and submitted under the provisions of this
section shall be, "Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Arkansas" (municipality, or county
as the case may be). In submitting measures to the people, the Secretary of State and all other
officials shall be guided by the general election laws or municipal laws, as the case may be, until
additional legislation is provided therefor.

Self-Executing - This section shall be self-executing, and all its provisions shall be treated as
mandatory, but laws may be enacted to facilitate its operation. No legislation shall be enacted to
restrict, hamper or impair the exercise of the rights herein reserved to the people.

That this amendment to the Constitution of the State be, and the same shall be in substitution of
the Initiative and Referendum Amendment, approved February 19, 1909, as the same appears in
the Acts of Arkansas for 1909, on pages 1239 and 1240 of the volume containing the same; and
that the said amendment (and the Act of the General Assembly to carry out the same, approved
June 30, 1911, so far as the same is in conflict therewith), be and the same are hereby repealed.

(Const., Article. 16, Section 1 Amended)

Neither the State nor any city, county, town or other municipality in the State, shall ever lend its
credit for any purpose whatever, nor shall any county, city, town or municipality ever issue any
interest-bearing evidences of indebtedness, except such bonds as may be authorized by law to
provide for and secure the payment of the indebtedness existing at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution of 1874, and the State shall never issue any interest-bearing treasury warrants or
scrip.

     Provided, that cities of the first and second class may issue by and with the consent of the
majority of the qualified electors of said municipality voting on the question at an election held
for the purpose, bonds in sums and for the purpose approved by such majority at such election as
follows:

     For the payment of any indebtedness existing at the time of the adoption of this
amendment for the purpose of rights of way for construction of public streets, alleys, and
boulevards within the corporate limits of such municipality; for the construction of, widening or
straightening of streets, alleys and boulevards within the corporate limits of such municipality;
for the purchase, development and improvement of public parks and flying fields located either
within or without the corporate limits of such municipality; for the construction of sewers and
comfort stations; for the purchase of fire fighting apparatus and fire alarm systems; for the
purchase of street cleaning apparatus; for the purchase of sites for, construction of, and
equipment of city halls, auditoriums, prisons, libraries, hospitals, public abattoirs, incinerators or
garbage disposal plants; for buildings for the housing of fire fighting apparatus; for the
construction of viaducts and bridges; and for the purpose of purchasing, extending, improving,
enlarging, building, or construction of water works or light plants, and distributing systems
therefor.

     No bonds issued under the authority of this amendment shall bear a greater rate of interest
than six per cent per annum payable either annually or semi-annually; that is to say, the cost to
the municipality of interest and discount, on each issue of bonds shall not exceed six per cent per
annum, and no bonds issued under the authority of this amendment shall ever be sold except at
public sale after twenty days' advertisement in some newspaper having bona fide circulation in
the municipality issuing such bonds.

     In order to provide for the payment of the bonds issued under the provisions of this
amendment, and interest thereof, a special tax not to exceed five mills may be levied by
municipalities on the real and taxable property therein.  And any municipality issuing any bonds,
shall before or at the time of doing so, levy a direct tax payable annually not exceeding the
amount limited as above, sufficient to pay the interest on such bonds as the same matures, and
also sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of all such bonds at their respective maturities;
provided, that the above limitations of the rate of taxation shall not apply to bonds issued by any
municipality for the purpose of acquiring, purchasing, extending, improving, enlarging, building
or construction of water works and light plants, but the levy of the special tax of five mills
authorized by this amendment having been exhausted, or the balance unlevied being insufficient
to pay interest on and retire the proposed bonds, said municipality for the purpose of paying the
principal and interest of such water works and light plant bonds, may, as far as required, levy and
collect a special tax, in addition to the rate allowed by this amendment of not to exceed five mills
on the dollar.

     Said bonds shall be serial, maturing annually after three years from the date of issue, and
shall be paid off as they mature, and no bonds issued under the authority of this amendment shall
be issued for a longer period than thirty-five years.

     No municipality shall ever grant financial aid toward the construction of railroads or other
private enterprises operated by any person, firm or corporation, and no money raised under the
provisions of this amendment by taxation or by sale of bonds for a specific purpose shall ever be
used for any other or different purpose.

     It shall be the duty of the mayor and city council or other governing body established by
law, to exercise supervision over the sale of any bonds, which may be voted by the people at an
election held for that purpose and they shall expend economically the funds so provided for the
specific purpose for which they were voted.

     Said election shall be held at such times as the city council may designate by ordinance,
which ordinance shall specifically state the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and if
for more than one purpose, provisions shall be made in said ordinance for balloting on each
separate purpose; which ordinance shall state the sum total of the issue, the date of maturity
thereof and shall fix the date of election so that it shall not occur earlier than thirty days after the
passage of said ordinance.  Said election shall be held and conducted, and the vote thereof
canvassed, and the result thereof declared under the law and in the manner now or hereafter
provided for municipal elections, so far as the same may be applicable, except as herein
otherwise provided.  Notice of said election shall be given by the mayor by advertisement weekly
for at least four times, in some newspaper published in said municipality and having a bona fide
circulation therein; the last publication to be not less than ten days prior to the date of said
election.

     Qualified voters of said municipality only shall have a right to vote at said election.  The
result of said election shall be proclaimed by the mayor and the result as proclaimed shall be
conclusive unless attacked in the courts within thirty days after the date of such proclamation. 
This amendment shall not repeal or affect any law relating to the organization of improvement
districts.

Tax to Aid Industries

City tax. - It being most apparent that factories, industries and transportation facilities are
necessary for the development of a community and for the welfare of its inhabitants, a special tax
not exceeding five mills on the dollar of all taxable property in cities of the first class located in
counties now or hereafter having not less than one hundred five thousand population, in addition
to other taxes now provided by law, may be levied in such cities for the period that may be
provided by law, when petitioned for by ten per cent of the owners of real property in such city
and on consent of a majority of the electors of such city voting on the question.

The proceeds of such tax shall be expended by a board of three commissioners, each of whom
shall be a taxpayer in such city, said commissioners, to serve for such term as may be provided
by law without compensation, except actual expenses. One of the commissioners shall be
selected by a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board, one by a majority of
the judges of the Circuit, County and Chancery Courts of the county, sitting as a board, and one
by a majority of the banks and trust companies located in such city whose representatives shall sit
as a board. Where there are two such cities in such county and the tax herein provided for has
been voted in each, one board of commissioners may be appointed for both cities if a majority of
the boards having the appointive power deem best, and in that event a majority of the banks and
trust companies in both cities shall appoint one commissioner, and the proceeds of the tax shall
be expended for the benefit of both cities.

The proceeds of such tax may be expended as may be provided by law for the purpose of
securing the location of factories, industries, river transportation and facilities therefor within and
adjacent to such cities or other public purposes, exclusive of charities and those now within the
powers of said cities to perform, and the expenditures may also be made for advertising such
cities and the State, or making secured loans to such factories and industries, or for any other
public purpose that may be provided by law, connected with securing the location of such
factories and industries and encouraging them.

The provisions of this amendment are separable, and if any should be held invalid the remainder
shall stand.

          agency provides services in a person's home, then the agency shall also provide
          voter registration services at the person's home. Disabilities agencies shall also
          provide declination forms as described in 51-6, which shall be retained for two (2)

                    (2) will become qualified electors during the thirty (30) day period immediately

          provided for by this amendment.

          (b) Registration shall be in progress at all times except during the thirty (30) day period

     be effective for subsequent elections.

               (c)  (1) The permanent registrar shall register qualified applicants when a legible and

          register to vote by mail using the state or federal mail voter registration
          application form if a legible and complete voter registration application form is
          postmarked not later than thirty (30) days before the date of the election, or, if the

 Sec. 10. Transfer and change of status.

          (a) Upon a change of legal residence within the county, or a change of name, any
     registered voter may cause his registration to be transferred to his new address or new
     name by completing and mailing a federal or state mail voter registration application
     form, by updating his address at the Office of Driver Services, any State Revenue Office,
     public assistance agency, disabilities agency or other voter registration agency, by signing
     a mailed request to the Permanent Registrar, giving his present address and the address at
     which he was last registered or his present name and the name under which he was last
     registered, or by applying in person at the office of the Permanent Registrar.

          (b) If the change of legal residence is made pursuant to subsection (a)or (c)(1) of this
     section during the thirty-day administrative cut-off period immediately prior to any
     election scheduled within the county the registered voter shall retain his right to vote in
     the scheduled election in the precinct to which he just moved.

          (c) The permanent registrar shall conduct a uniform, non-discriminatory address
     confirmation program during each odd numbered year to ensure that voter registration
     lists are accurate and current. The address confirmation program shall be completed not
     later than ninety (90) days prior to a primary or general election for federal office. Based
     on change of address data received from the United States Postal Service or its licensees,
     or other unconfirmed data indicating that a registered voter no longer resides at his or her
     registered address, the permanent registrar shall send a forwardable address confirmation
     notice, including a postage-paid and pre-addressed return card, to enable the voter to
     verify or correct the address information.

                    (1) If change of address data indicates that the voter has moved to a new residence
          address in the same county and, if the county is divided into more than one (1)
          congressional district, the same congressional district, the address confirmation
          notice shall contain the following statement:

                    "We have received notification that you have moved to a new address in .........
          County (or in the .... Congressional District). We will re-register you at your new
          address unless, within ten (10) days you notify us that your change of address is
          not a change of your permanent residence. You may notify us by returning the
          attached postage-paid postcard or by calling (...) ...-..... If this is not a permanent
          change of residence and if you do not notify us within ten (10) days you may be
          required to update your residence address in order to vote at future elections."

                    (2) If the change of address data indicates that the voter has moved to a new
          address in another county or, if a county is divided into more than one (1)
          congressional district, to a new address in the same county but in a new
          congressional district, the notice shall include the following statement:

 
                    "We have received notification that you have moved to a new address not in .........
          County (or not in the Congressional District). If you no longer live in .........
          County (or in the .... Congressional District), you must re-register at your new
          residence address in order to vote in the next election. If you are still an Arkansas
          resident, you may obtain a form to register to vote by calling your County Clerk's
          Office or the Secretary of State. If your change of address is not a change of your
          permanent residence, you must return the attached postage-paid postcard. If you
          do not return this card and continue to reside in ......... County (and in the ....
          Congressional District), you may be required to provide identification and update
          your residence address in order to vote at future elections, and if you do not vote
          at any election in the period between the date of this notice and the second federal
          general election after the date of this notice, your voter registration will be
          canceled and you will have to re-register in order to vote. If the change of address
          is permanent, please return the attached postage-paid postcard which will assist us
          in keeping our voter registration records accurate."

          (d) Based on change of address information received pursuant to subsections (a) and (c),
     the permanent registrar shall:

                    (1) update and correct the voter's registration if the information indicates that the
          voter has moved to a new address within the same county and the same
          congressional district;

                    (2) designate the voter as inactive if the information indicates the voter has moved
          to a new address in another county or to a new address in another congressional
          district in the same county, or if the address confirmation notices have been
          returned as undeliverable; or

                    (3) cancel the voter registration in the county from which the voter has moved if
          the voter verifies in writing that he or she has moved to a residence address in
          another county."

Sec. 14. Procedure for adjustment of taxes after reappraisal or reassessment of property.

          (a) Whenever a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property subject to ad valorem
     taxes made in accordance with procedures established by the General Assembly shall
     result in an increase in the aggregate value of taxable real and personal property in any
     taxing unit in this State of ten percent (10%) or more over the previous year the rate of city
     or town, county, school district, and community college district taxes levied against the
     taxable real and personal property of each such taxing unit shall, upon completion of such
     reappraisal or reassessment, be adjusted or rolled back, by the governing body of the
     taxing unit, for the year for which levied as provided below. The General Assembly shall,
     by law, establish the procedures to be followed by a county in making a countywide
     reappraisal or reassessment of property which will, upon completion, authorize the
     adjustment or rollback of property tax rates or millage, as authorized hereinabove. The
     adjustment or rollback of tax rates or millage for the "base year" as hereinafter defined
     shall be designed to assure that each taxing unit will receive an amount of tax revenue
     from each tax source no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues received during
     the previous year from each such tax source, adjusted for any lawful tax or millage rate
     increase or reduction imposed in the manner provided by law for the year for which the tax
     adjustment or rollback is to be made, and after making the following additional
     adjustments:

                    (i) By excluding from such calculation the assessed value of, and taxes derived
          from, tangible personal property assessed in the taxing unit, and all real and
          tangible personal property of public utilities and regulated carriers assessed in the
          taxing unit, and

                    (ii) By computing the adjusted or rollback millage rates on the basis of the
          reassessed taxable real property for the base year that will produce an amount of
          revenue no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues produced from the
          assessed value of real property in the taxing unit (after making the aforementioned
          adjustments for personal properties and properties of public utilities and regulated
          carriers noted above) from millage rates in effect in the taxing unit during the base
          year in which the millage adjustment or rollback is to be calculated. Provided,
          further, that in calculating the amount of adjusted or rollback millage necessary to
          produce tax revenues no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues
          received during the previous year, the governing body shall separate from the
          assessed value of taxable real property of the taxing unit, newly-discovered real
          property and new construction and improvements to real property, after making the
          adjustments for personal property or property of public utilities and regulated
          carriers noted above, and shall compute the millage necessary to produce an
          amount of revenues equal to, but no greater than the base year revenues of the
          taxing unit from each millage source. Such taxing unit may elect either to obtain an
          increase in revenues equal to the amount of revenues that the computed or adjusted
          rollback millage will produce from newly-discovered real property and new
          construction and improvements to real property, or if the same be less than ten
          percent (10%), the governing body of the taxing unit may recompute the millage
          rate to be charged to produce an amount no greater than ten percent (10%) above
          the revenues collected for taxable real property during the base year.

                    Provided, however, that the amount of revenues to be derived from taxable
          personal property assessed in the taxing unit for the base year, other than personal
          property taxes to be paid by public utilities and regulated carriers in the manner
          provided herein above, shall be computed at the millage necessary to produce the
          same dollar amount of revenues derived during the current year in which the base
          year adjustment or rollback of millage is computed, and the millage necessary to
          produce the amount of revenues received from personal property taxes received by
          the taxing unit, for the base year shall be reduced annually as the assessed value of
          taxable personal property increases until the amount of revenues from personal
          property taxes, computed on the basis of the current year millage rates will produce
          an amount of revenues from taxable personal property equal to or greater than
          received during the base year, and thereafter the millage rates for computing
          personal property taxes shall be the millage rates levied for the current year.

                    Provided, however, that the taxes to be paid by public utilities and regulated
          carriers in the respective taxing units of the several counties of this State during the
          first five (5) calendar years in which taxes are levied on the taxable real and
          personal property as reassessed and equalized in each of the respective counties as
          a part of a statewide reappraisal program, shall be the greater of the following:

                              (1) The amount of taxes paid on property owned by such public utilities or
               regulated carriers in or assigned to such taxing unit, less adjustments for
               properties disposed of or reductions in the assessed valuation of such
               properties in the base year as defined below, or

                              (2) The amount of taxes due on the assessed valuation of taxable real and
               tangible personal property belonging to the public utilities or regulated
               carriers located in or assigned to the taxing unit in each county at millage
               rates levied for the current year.

                    As used herein, the term "base year" shall mean the year in which a county
          completes reassessment and equalization of taxable real and personal property as a
          part of a statewide reappraisal program, and extends the adjusted or rolled back
          millage rates for the first time, as provided in subsection (a) of this Section, for the
          respective taxing units in such county for collection in the following year.

                    (i) In the event the amount of taxes paid the taxing unit in a county in the base year,
          as defined herein, is greater than the taxes due to be paid to such taxing unit for the
          current year of any year of the second (2nd) period of five (5) years after the base
          year, the difference between the base year taxes and the current year taxes for any
          year of such five (5) year period shall be adjusted as follows:

                              Current year of Taxes shall be current year taxes second period of (5) to
               which shall be added the years following percentage of the difference
               between the current year taxes and the base year taxes (if greater than
               current year taxes) 

                         1st year 80% of difference

                         2nd year 60% of difference

          treatment provided or required under the court order, if deemed necessary to

Sec. 9. Joint project of various governing bodies - Compact agreement elections.

Whenever two or more cities of the First or Second Class, or incorporated towns, and/or one or
more counties and the school districts therein, desire to join together in a combined effort to
secure and develop industries within one or more of such cities, towns, counties, and share in the
increased revenues estimated to be received by the city, town, or county, or school district, in
which the industry or industries are to be located, they may, upon adoption by the governing
bodies of each such city, town, school district, or county, enter into a compact setting forth the
terms by which each of the participating cities, towns, school districts, and counties is to share in
the revenues to be derived from the location of an industrial plant within the compact area through
the combined efforts of the various participating cities, towns, school districts, and counties. Upon
adoption of such compact by the governing bodies of the participating cities, towns, school
districts, and/or counties, the county court of each of the counties involved shall cause a special
election to be called within not more than forty-five (45) days from the date of the filing of such
compact with the county court. At such special election, the qualified electors of each of the cities,
towns, school districts, and counties shall vote on whether to approve the compact and the method
of sharing in increased revenues to be derived by the city, school district, and/or county in which
the proposed industry is to be located among the various participating cities, towns, counties, and
school districts. The ballot at such election shall be in substantially the following form:

          "FOR the establishment of an 
     industrial development compact

     taxes to be generated by

Said election shall be conducted in accordance with the election laws of this State, and the results
thereof tabulated and certified to the County Clerk in the manner now provided by law. If a
majority of the qualified electors voting on the question vote in favor of the creation of the
compact, and the sharing of revenues to be derived from new industries located in the compact
area, the said compact shall be implemented in accordance with the terms thereof. If a majority of
the qualified electors voting on said issue vote against issue at said special election, no additional
election on said issue may be held within one (1) year from the date of said election. The results of
said election shall be proclaimed by the county court of each of the counties in which the county
and/or cities and towns, or school districts, are located. The results of said election shall be
conclusive unless attacked in the courts within thirty (30) days.

Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission

          (a) COMMISSION: Under the judicial power of the State, a Judicial Discipline and
     Disability Commission is established and shall be comprised of nine persons: three
     justices or judges, appointed by the Supreme Court; three licensed attorneys in good
     standing who are not justices or judges, one appointed by the Attorney General, one by the
     President of the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House; and three members
     appointed by the Governor. The members appointed by the Governor shall not be justices
     or judges, retired justices or judges, or attorneys. Alternate members shall be selected and
     vacancies filled in the same manner.

          (b) DISCIPLINE, SUSPENSION, LEAVE, AND REMOVAL: The Commission may
     initiate, and shall receive and investigate, complaints concerning misconduct of all justices
     and judges, and requests and suggestions for leave or involuntary disability retirement.
     Any judge or justice may voluntarily request that the Commission recommend suspension
     because of pending disciplinary action or leave because of a mental or physical disability.
     Grounds for sanctions imposed by the Commission or recommendations made by the
     Commission shall be violations of the professional and ethical standards governing
     judicial officers, conviction of a felony, or physical or mental disability that prevents the
     proper performance of judicial duties. Grounds for suspension, leave, or removal from
     office shall be determined by legislative enactment.

          (c) DISCIPLINE: If, after notice and hearing, the Commission by majority vote of the
     membership determines that grounds exist for the discipline of a judge or justice, it may
     reprimand or censure the judge or justice, who may appeal to the Supreme Court. The
     Commission may, if it determines that grounds exist, after notice and hearing, and by
     majority vote of the membership, recommend to the Supreme Court that a judge or justice
     be suspended, with or without pay, or be removed, and the Supreme court, en banc, may
     take such action. Under this amendment, a judge who also has executive or legislative
     responsibilities shall be suspended or removed only from judicial duties. In any hearing
     involving a Supreme Court justice, all Supreme Court justices shall be disqualified from
     participation.

          (d) LEAVE AND RETIREMENT: If, after notice and hearing, the Commission by
     majority vote of the membership determines that a judge or justice is unable because of
     physical or mental disability to perform the duties of office, the Commission may
     recommend to the Supreme Court that the judge or justice be granted leave with pay or be
     retired, and the Supreme Court, en banc, may take such action. A judge or justice retired
     by the Supreme Court shall be considered to have retired voluntarily as provided by law.

          (e) VACANCIES: Vacancies created by suspension, the granting of leave or the removal
     of a judge or justice, or vacancies created by disqualification of justices, shall be filled as
     provided by law.

          (f) RULES: The Supreme Court shall make procedural rules implementing this
     amendment and setting the length of terms on the Commission.

          (g) CUMULATIVE NATURE: This amendment is alternative to, and cumulative with,

Arkansas Term Limitation Amendment

Preamble: The people of Arkansas find and declare that elected officials who remain in office too
long become preoccupied with reelection and ignore their duties as representatives of the people.
Entrenched incumbency has reduced voter participation and has led to an electoral system that is
less free, less competitive, and less representative than the system established by the Founding
Fathers. Therefore, the people of Arkansas, exercising their reserved powers, herein limit the
terms of elected officials.

Amendment 74.

Uniform Minimum Property Tax for Schools

(CONST., ART.14, SEC.3 AMENDED; NOT YET CODIFIED)

 

Sec. 1 of Amend. No. 74. Section 3 of Article 14 of the Arkansas Constitution, as amended by
Amendments 11 and 40 is amended to read as follows:

"Section 3. School tax - Budget - Approval of tax rate.

The General Assembly shall provide for the support of common schools by general law. In order
to provide quality education, it is the goal of this state to provide a fair system for the distribution
of funds. It is recognized that, in providing such a system, some funding variations may be
necessary. The primary reason for allowing such variations is to allow school districts, to the
extent permissible, to raise additional funds to enhance the educational system within the school
district. It is further recognized that funding variations or restrictions thereon may be necessary in
order to comply with, or due to, other provisions of this Constitution, the United States
Constitution, state or federal laws, or court orders.
          
          (1) There is established a uniform rate of ad valorem property tax of twenty-five (25) mills
     to be levied on the assessed value of all taxable real, personal, and utility property in the
     state to be used solely for maintenance and operation of the schools.

          (2) Except as provided in this subsection the uniform rate of tax shall not be an additional
     levy for maintenance and operation of the schools but shall replace a portion of the
     existing rate of tax levied by each school district available for maintenance and operation
     of schools in the school district. The rate of tax available for maintenance and operation
     levied by each school district on the effective date of this amendment shall be reduced to
     reflect the levy of the uniform rate of tax. If the rate of tax available for maintenance and
     operation levied by a school district on the effective date of this amendment exceeds the
     uniform rate of tax, the excess rate of tax shall continue to be levied by the school district
     until changed as provided in subsection (c)(1). If the rate of tax available for maintenance
     and operation levied by a school district on the effective date of this amendment is less
     than the uniform rate of tax, the uniform rate of tax shall nevertheless be levied in the
     district.

          (3) The uniform rate of tax shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as other
     school property taxes, but the net revenues from the uniform rate of tax shall be remitted
     to the State Treasurer and distributed by the state to the school districts as provided by law.
     No portion of the revenues from the uniform rate of tax shall be retained by the state. The
     revenues so distributed shall be used by the school districts solely for maintenance and
     operation of schools.

          (4) The General Assembly may by law propose an increase or decrease in the uniform rate
     of tax and submit the question to the electors of the state at the next general election. If a
     majority of the electors of the state voting on the issue vote _For_ the proposed increase or
     decrease in the uniform rate of tax, the uniform rate of tax shall be increased or decreased
     as approved. If a majority of the electors of the state voting on the issue vote _Against_ the
     proposed increase or decrease in the uniform rate of tax, the uniform rate of tax shall
     continue to be levied at the rate for the year in which the election is held.

                    (C)(1) In addition to the uniform rate of tax provided in subsection (b), school
          districts are authorized to levy, by a vote of the qualified electors respectively
          thereof, an annual ad valorem property tax on the assessed value of taxable real,
          personal, and utility property for the maintenance and operation of schools and the
          retirement of indebtedness. The Board of Directors of each school district shall
          prepare, approve and make public not less than sixty (60) days in advance of the
          annual school election a proposed budget of expenditures deemed necessary to
          provide for the foregoing purposes, together with a rate of tax levy sufficient to
          provide the funds therefor, including the rate under any continuing levy for the
          retirement of indebtedness. The Board of Directors shall submit the tax at the
          annual school election or at such other time as may be provided by law. If a
          majority of the qualified voters in the school district voting in the school election
          approve the rate of tax proposed by the Board of Directors, then the tax at the rate
          approved shall be collected as provided by law. In the event a majority of the
          qualified electors voting in the school election disapprove the proposed rate of tax,
          then the tax shall be collected at the rate approved in the last preceding school
          election. However, if the rate last approved has been modified pursuant to
          subsection (b) or (c)(2) of this section, then the tax shall be collected at the
          modified rate until another rate is approved.

                    (2) The tax levied by a school district pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section
          may be reduced pursuant to procedures provided by law if the tax would cause the
          state or district to be out of compliance with any other provision of this
          Constitution, the United States Constitution, state or federal law, or court order.

                    (3) No tax levied pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be appropriated
          to any other district than that for which it is levied.

          (d) For the purposes of this section, 'maintenance and operation' means such expenses for
     the general maintenance and operation of schools as may be defined by law."

Sec.2. of Amend. 74. Nothing in this Amendment shall be construed to diminish the authority of
school districts over the supervision of public schools.

Sec. 3. of Amend. 74. Any provision of the Constitution of the State of Arkansas in conflict with
this Amendment is repealed in so far as it is in conflict with this Amendment.

Sec. 4. of Amend. 74. This Amendment shall become effective on adoption and shall apply to
taxes due in 1997 and thereafter.
