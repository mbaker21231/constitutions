  bill passed during the last three days of the session which is not signed and deposited
  within 14 days after adjournment does not become a law.

  he may veto one or more of the items while approving the bill. At the time he signs the
  bill the governor shall append to it a statement of the items he vetoes and the vetoed items
  shall not take effect. If the legislature is in session, he shall transmit to the house in which
  the bill originated a copy of the statement, and the items vetoed shall be separately
  reconsidered. If on reconsideration any item is approved by two-thirds of the members
  elected to each house, it is a part of the law notwithstanding the objections of the

  Sec. 2.  Every law which upon its effective date applies to a single local government unit
  or to a group of such units in a single county or a number of contiguous counties is a
  special law and shall name the unit or, in the latter case, the counties to which it applies.
  The legislature may enact special laws relating to local government units, but a special
  law, unless otherwise provided by general law, shall become effective only after its
  approval by the affected unit expressed through the voters or the governing body and by
  such majority as the legislature may direct.  Any special law may be modified or
  superseded by a later home rule charter or amendment applicable to the same local
  government unit, but this does not prevent the adoption of subsequent laws on the same
  subject. The legislature may repeal any existing special or local law, but shall not amend,
  extend or modify any of the same except as provided in this section.

  voters of the local government unit as the legislature prescribes by general law. If a
  charter provides for the consolidation or separation of a city and a county, in whole or in
  part, it shall not be effective without approval of the voters both in the city and in the
  remainder of the county by the majority required by law.

  Sec. 5. The legislature shall provide by law for charter commissions. Notwithstanding any
  other constitutional limitations the legislature may require that commission members be
  freeholders, provide for their appointment by judges of the district court, and permit any
  member to hold any other elective or appointive office other than judicial. Home rule
  charter amendments may be proposed by a charter commission or by a petition of five
  percent of the voters of the local government unit as determined by law and shall not
  become effective until approved by the voters by the majority required by law.
  Amendments may be proposed and adopted in any other manner provided by law. A local
  government unit may repeal its home rule charter and adopt a statutory form of
  government or a new charter upon the same majority vote as is required by law for the
  adoption of a charter in the first instance.
