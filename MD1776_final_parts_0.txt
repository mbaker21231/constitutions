 A  Declaration of Rights, and the Constitution and Form of Government agreed to by the
 Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Convention assembled.

*** ASTART 9002.0 MD 1776 ***

A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, &C.

THE parliament of Great Britain, by a declaratory act, having assumed a right to make laws to
bind the
Colonies in all cases whatsoever, and, in pursuance of such claim, endeavoured, by force of
arms, to
subjugate the United Colonies to an unconditional submission to their will and power, and
having at
length constrained them to declare themselves independent States, and to assume government
under the
authority of the people;-Therefore we, the Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Convention
assembled, taking into our most serious consideration the best means of establishing a good
Constitution in this State, for the sure foundation and more permanent security thereof, declare,

*** SSTART 001.0 9002.0 0 MD 1776 ***

I. That all government of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and
instituted
solely for the good of the whole.

III. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by
jury
according to the course of that law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes, as existed at
the
time of their first emigration, and which, by experience, have been found applicable to their local
and
other circumstances, and of such others as have been since made in England, or Great Britain,
and have
been introduced, used and practised by the courts of law or equity; and also to acts of Assembly,
in
force on the first of June seventeen hundred and seventy-four, except such as may have since
expired,
or have been or may be altered by acts of Convention, or this Declaration of Rights--subject,
nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State: and
the
inhabitants of Maryland are also entitled to all property, derived to them, from or under the
Charter,
granted by his Majesiy Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, Baron of Baltimore.

government
are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are
ineffectual,
the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or establish a new government. The
doctrine of

good

Quakers,
those called Dunkers, and those called Menonists, holding it unlawful to take an oath on any
occasion,
ought to be allowed to make their solemn affirmation, in the manner that Quakers have been
heretofore
allowed to affirm; and to be of the same avail as an oath, in all such cases, as the affirmation of
Quakers
hath been allowed and accepted within this State, instead of an oath. And further, on such
affirmation,
warrants to search for stolen goods, or for the apprehension or commitment of offenders, ought
to be
granted, or security for the peace awarded, and Quakers, Dunkers or Menonists ought also, on
their
solemn affirmation as aforesaid, to be admitted as witnesses, in all criminal cases not capital.
