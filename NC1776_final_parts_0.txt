25. The property of the soil, in a free government, being one of the essential rights of the
collective body of the people, it is necessary, in order to avoid future disputes, that the limits of
the State should be ascertained with precision: and as the f ormer temporary line between
North and South Carolina was confirmed, and extended by commissioners, appointed by the
legislatures of the two States, agreeable to the order of the late King George II in council, that
line, and that only, should be esteemed the southern boundary of this State; that is to say,
beginning on the seaside at a cedar stake at or near the mouth of Little River, (being the southern
extremity of Brunswick County), and running from thence a northwest course, through the
boundary-house, which stands in thirty-three degrees fifty-six minutes, to a thirty-five degrees
north latitude; and from thence a west course, so far as is mentioned in the charter of King
Charles II to the late proprietors of Carolina. Therefore, all the territory, seas, waters, and
harbors, with their appurtenances, lying between the line above described, and the southern line
of the State of Virginia, which begins on the seashore, in thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north
latitude, and from thence runs west, agreeable to the said charter of King Charles, are the right
and property of the people of this State, to be held by them in sovereignty: any partial line,
without the consent of the legislature of this State, at any time thereafter directed or laid out, in a
ny wise notwithstanding: provided always, that this declaration of right shall not prejudice any
nation or nations of Indians, from enjoying such hunting grounds as may have been, or hereafter
shall be secured to them, by any former or future legislature of this State: And provided also, that 
it shall not be construed so as to prevent the establishment of one or more governments westward
of this State, by consent of the legislature:  And provided further, that nothing herein contained
shall affect the titles or possessions of individuals holding or claiming under the laws heretofore
in force, or grants heretofore made by the late King George II, or his predecessors, or the late
lords proprietors, or any of them.

 THE CONSTITUTION

 The Constitution, or form of Government, agreed to and Resolved upon, by the Representatives
of the freemen of the State of North Carolina, elected and chosen for that particular purpose, in
Congress assembled, at Halifax, the eighteenth day of December , in the year of our Lord one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-six.

Whereas, allegiance and protection are in their nature reciprocal, and the one should of right be
refused when the other is withdrawn;

And whereas, George the Third, king of Great Britain, and late sovereign of the Brit ish
American colonies, hath not only withdrawn from them his protection, but, by an act of the
British legislature, declared the inhabitants of these States out of the protection of the British
crown, and all their property found upon the high-seas liable to be seized and confiscated to the
uses mentioned in the said act; and the said George the Third has also sent fleets and armies to
prosecute a cruel war against them, for the purpose of reducing the inhabitants of the said
colonies to a state of object slavery; in consequence whereof, all government, under the said
king, within the said colonies, hath ceased, and a total dissolution of government, in many of
them, hath taken place:

And whereas, the continental congress, having considered the premises, and other previous
violations of the rights of the good people of America, have therefore declared that the thirteen
united colonies are, of right, wholly absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, or any
other foreign jurisdiction whatsoever; and that the said colonies now are, and forever shall be,
free and independent states. Wherefore, in our present State, in order to prevent anarchy and
confusion, it becomes necessary that government should be established in this State; therefore,
we the representatives of the freemen of North Carolina, chosen and assembled in congress for
the express purpose of framing a constitution, under the authority of the people, most conducive
to their happiness and prosperity, do declare, that a government for this State shall be established,
in manner and form following, to wit:
