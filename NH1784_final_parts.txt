CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE   1784 

     PART I.   THE BILL OF RIGHTS


*** ASTART 001.0 NH 1874 ***


     ARTICLE I

*** SSTART 001.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     All men are born equally free and independent; therefore, all government of right originates
from the people, is founded in consent, and instituted for the general good.



*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 002.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     II. All men have certain natural, essential, and inherent rights; among which are   the enjoying
and defending life and liberty   acquiring, possessing and protecting property-and in a word, of
seeking and obtaining happiness.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 003.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     III. When men enter into a state of society, they surrender up some of their natural rights
to that society, in order to insure the protection of others; and, without such an equivalent, the
surrender is void.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 004.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***


     IV. Among the natural rights, some are in their very nature unalienable, because no
equivalent can be given or received for them. Of this kind are the RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 005.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     V. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship GOD according to the
dictates of his own conscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in
his person, liberty or estate for worshipping GOD, in the manner and season most agreeable to the
dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profession, sentiments or persuasion; provided
he doth not disturb the public peace, or disturb others, in their religious worship.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 006.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     VI. As morality and piety, rightly grounded on evangelical principles, will give the best
and greatest security to government, and will lay in the hearts of men the strongest obligations to
due subjection; and as the knowledge of these, is most likely to be propagated through a society
by the institution of the public worship of the DEITY, and of public instruction in morality and
religion; therefore, to promote those important purposes, the people of this state have a right to
impower, and do hereby fully impower the legislature to authorize from time to time, the several
towns, parishes, bodies-corporate, or religious societies within this state, to make adequate
provision at their own expence, for the support and maintenance of public protestant teachers of
piety, religion and morality:
     Provided notwithstanding, That the several towns, parishes, bodies-corporate, or religious
societies, shall at all times have the exclusive right of electing their own public teachers, and of
contracting with them for their support and maintenance. And no portion of any one particular
religious sect or denomination, shall ever be compelled to pay towards the support of the teacher
or teachers of another persuasion, sect or denomination.
     And every denomination of christians demeaning themselves quietly, and as good subjects
of the state, shall be equally under the protection of the law: and no subordination of any one sect
or denomination to another, shall ever be established by law.
     And nothing herein shall be understood to affect any former contracts made for the
support of the ministry; but all such contracts shall remain, and be in the same state as if this
constitution had not been made.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 007.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     VII. The people of this state, have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as
a free, sovereign, and independent state, and do, and forever hereafter shall, exercise and enjoy
every power, jurisdiction and right pertaining thereto, which is not, or may not hereafter be by
them expressly delegated to the United States of America in Congress assembled.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 008.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     VIII. All power residing originally in, and being derived from the people, all the
magistrates and officers of government, are their substitutes and agents, and at all times
accountable to them.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 009.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

    IX. No office or place whatsoever in government, shall be hereditary-the abilities and integrity
requisite in all, not being transmissible to posterity or relations.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 010.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

X. Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the whole
community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family or class of men;
therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly
endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to
reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary
power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 011.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XI. All elections ought to be free, and every inhabitant of the state having the proper
qualifications, has equal right to elect, and be elected into office.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 012.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XII. Every member of the community has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of
his life, liberty and property; he is therefore bound to contribute his share in the expence of such
protection, and to yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent. But no part of a
man's property shall be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that
of the representative body of the people. Nor are the inhabitants of this state controllable by any
other laws than those to which they or their representative body have given their consent.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 013.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XIII. No person who is conscientiously scrupulous about the lawfulness of bearing arms,
shall be compelled thereto, provided he will pay an equivalent.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 014.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XIV. Every subject of this state is entitled to a certain remedy, by having recourse to the
laws, for all injuries lie may receive in his person, property or character, to obtain right and justice
freely, without being obliged to purchase it; completely, and without any denial; promptly, and
without delay, conformably to the laws.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 015.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XV. No subject shall be held to answer for any crime, or offence, until the same is fully
and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse or furnish
evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be
favorable to himself; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his
defence by himself, and counsel. And no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled or
deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled or
deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 016.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XVI. No subject shall be liable to be tried, after an acquittal, for the same crime or
offence. --Nor shall the legislature make any law that shall subject any person to a capital
punishment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, and the militia in actual service,
without trial by jury.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 017.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XVII. In criminal prosecutions, the trial of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is so
essential to the security of the life, liberty and estate of the citizen, that no crime or offence ought
to be tried in any other county than that in which it is committed; except in cases of general
insurrection in any particular county, when it shall appear to the Judges of the Superior Court,
that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the offence may be committed, and upon
their report, the assembly shall think proper to direct the trial in the nearest county in which an
impartial trial can be obtained.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 018.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XVIII. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offence. No wise
legislature will affix the same punishment to the crimes of theft, forgery and the like, which they
do to those of murder and treason; where the same undistinguishing severity is exerted against all
offences; the people are led to forget the real distinction in the crimes themselves, and to commit
the most flagrant with as little compunction as they do those of the lightest dye: For the same
reason a multitude of sanguinary laws is both impolitic and unjust. The true design of all
punishments being to reform, not to exterminate, mankind.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 019.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XIX. Every subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures
of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary
to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath, or
affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or
to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a
special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure; and no warrant ought to
be issued but in cases, and with the formalities prescribed by the laws.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 020.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XX.  In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons,
except in causes in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practiced, the parties have a
right to a trial by jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless in causes arising
on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners wages, the legislature shall think it necessary
hereafter to alter it.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 021.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

   XXI. In order to reap the fullest advantage of the inestimable privilege of the trial by Jury, great
care ought to be taken that none but qualified persons be appointed to serve; and such ought to be
fully compensated for their travel, time and attendance.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 022.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXII. The Liberty of the Press is essential to the security of freedom in a state; it ought,
therefore, to be inviolably preserved.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 023.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXIII. Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws, therefore,
should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offences.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 024.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

      XXIV. A well regulated militia is the proper, natural, and sure defence of a state.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 025.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

      XXV. Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without
the consent of the legislature.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 026.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXVI. In all cases, and at all times, the military ought to be under strict subordination to, and
governed by the civil power.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 027.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

      XXVII. No soldier in time of peace, shall be quartered in any house without the consent of
the owner; and in time of war, quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a
manner ordained by the legislature.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 028.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

        XXVIII. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost or duty shall be established, fixed, laid, or
levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people or their representatives in
the legislature, or authority derived from that body.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 029.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

        XXIX. The power of suspending the laws, or the execution of them, ought never to be
exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived therefrom, to be exercised in such
particular cases only as the legislature shall expressly provide for.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 030.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

        XXX. The freedom of deliberation, speech, and debate, in either house of the legislature,
is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any action, complaint,
or prosecution, in any other court or place whatsoever.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 031.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

        XXXI. The legislature ought frequently to assemble for the redress of grievances, for
correcting, strengthening and confirming the laws and for making new ones, as the common good
may require.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 032.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

         XXXII. The people have a right in an orderly and peaceable manner, to assemble and
consult upon the common good, give instructions to their representatives; and to request of the
legislative body, by way of petition or remonstrance, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the
grievances they suffer.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 033.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

        XXXIII. No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose
excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 034.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***


     XXXIV. No person can in any case be subjected to law martial, or to any pains, or penalties,
by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual
service, but by authority of the legislature.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 035.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXXV. It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty,
property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of
justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will
admit. It is therefore not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, that
the judges of the supreme (or superior) judicial court should hold their offices so long as they
behave well; and that they should have honorable salaries, ascertained and established by standing
laws.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 036.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***


     XXXVI. Economy being a most essential virtue in all states, especially in a young one; no
pension shall be granted, but in consideration of actual services, and such pensions ought to be
granted with great caution, by the legislature, and never for more than one year at a time.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 037.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXXVII. In the government of this state, the three essential powers thereof, to wit, the
legislative, executive and judicial, ought to be kept as separate from and independent of each
other, as the nature of a free government will admit, or as is consistent with that chain of
connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of union and
amity.


*** SEND ***
*** SSTART 038.0 001.0 0 NH 1784 ***

     XXXVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, and a
constant adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, industry, frugality, and all the social
virtues, are indispensably necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty and good government; the
people ought, therefore, to have a particular regard to all principles in the choice of their officers
and representatives: and they have a right to require of their law-givers and magistrates, an exact
and constant observance of them in the formation and execution of the laws necessary for the
good administration of government.

   THE general court shall forever have full power and authority to erect and constitute

   AND farther, full power and authority are hereby given and granted to the said general court,
from time to time, to make, ordain and establish, all manner of wholesome and reasonable orders,
laws, statutes, ordinances, directions and instructions, either with penalties or without; so as the

welfare of this state, and for the governing and ordering thereof, and of the subjects of the same,
for the necessary support and defence of the government thereof; and to name and settle annually,

and preservation of the subjects thereof, according to such acts as are, or shall be in force within
the same.
   AND while the public charges of government or any part thereof shall be assessed on polls and
estates in the manner that has heretofore been practiced; in order that such assessments may be
made with equality, there shall be a valuation of the estates within the state taken anew once in
every five years at least, and as much oftener as the general court shall order.

SENATE

   THERE shall be annually elected by the freeholders and other inhabitants of this state, qualified
as in this constitution is provided, twelve persons to be senators for the year ensuing their
election; to be chosen in and by the inhabitants of the districts, into which this state may from time
to time be divided by the general court for that purpose; and the general court in assigning- the
number to be elected by the respective districts, shall govern themselves by the proportion of
public taxes paid by the said districts; and timely make known to the inhabitants of the state the
limits of each district, and the number of senators to be elected therein ; provided the number of
such districts shall never be more than ten, nor less than five.
[In the original document, the section on the Senate preceeded the section on the House of
Representatives, when the document was renumbered in 1792, the section on the House of
Representatives, beginning with Article 9, was placed first.]
     AND the several counties in this state, shall, until the general court shall order otherwise, be
districts for the election of senators, and shall elect the following number, viz.
     ROCKINGHAM, five. STRAFFORD, two. HILLSBOROUGH, two. CHESHIRE, two.
GRAFTON, one.  
  THE senate shall be the first branch of the legislature: and the senators shall be chosen in the
following manner, viz. Every male inhabitant of each town and parish with town privileges in the
several counties in this state, of twenty-one years of age and upwards, paying for himself a poll
tax, shall have a right at the annual or other meetings of the inhabitants of said towns and
parishes, to be duly warned and holden annually forever in the month of March; to vote in the
town or parish wherein he dwells, for the senators in the county or district whereof he is a
member.
     AND every person qualified as the constitution provides, shall be considered an inhabitant
for the purpose of electing and being elected into any office or place within this state, in that
town, parish and plantation where he dwelleth and hath his home.
     THE selectmen of the several towns and parishes aforesaid, shall, during the choice of
senators, preside at such meetings impartially and shall receive the votes of all the inhabitants of
such towns and parishes present and qualified to vote for senators, and shall sort and count the
same in the meeting, and in presence of the town-clerk who shall make a fair record in presence of
the selectmen, and in open meeting, of the name of every person voted for, and the number of
votes against his name; and a fair copy of this record shall be attested by the selectmen and town-
clerk, and shall be sealed up and directed to the secretary of the state, with a superscription
expressing the purport thereof, and delivered by said clerk to the sheriff of the county in which
such town or parish lies, thirty days at least, before the first Wednesday of June; and the sheriff of
each county, or his deputy, shall deliver all such certificates by him received, into the secretary's
office, seventeen days at least, before the first Wednesday of June.
     AND the inhabitants of plantations and places unincorporated, qualified as this
constitution provides, who are or shall be required to assess taxes upon themselves towards the
support of government, or shall be taxed therefor, shall have the same privilege of voting for
senators in the plantations and places wherein they reside, as the inhabitants of the respective
towns and parishes aforesaid have. And the meetings of such plantations and places for that
purpose, shall be holden annually in the month of March, at such places respectively therein, as
the assessors thereof shall direct; which assessors shall have like authority for notifying the
electors, collecting and returning the votes, as the selectmen and town-clerks have in their several
towns by this constitution.
     AND, that there may be a due meeting of senators, on the first Wednesday of June,
annually, the president and three of the council for the time being, shall as soon as may, examine
the returned copies of such records; and fourteen days before the said first Wednesday of June, he
shall issue his summons to such persons, as appear to be chosen senators by a majority of votes,
to attend and take their seats on that day: Provided, nevertheless, that for the first year the said
returned copies shall be examined by the president and five of the council of the former
constitution of government; and the said president shall in like manner notify the persons elected,
to attend and take their seats accordingly.
   THE senate shall be final judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own
members, as pointed out in this constitution, and shall on the said first Wednesday of June
annually, determine and declare, who are elected by each district to be senators by a majority of
votes: and in case there shall not appear to be the full number returned elected by a majority of
votes for any district, the deficiency shall be supplied in the following manner, viz. The members
of the house of representatives and such senators as shall be declared elected, shall take the names
of such persons as shall be found to have the highest number of votes in each district, and not
elected, amounting to twice the number of senators wanting- if there be so many voted for; and
out of these shall elect by joint ballot the number of senators wanted for such district: and in this
manner all such vacancies shall be filled up in every district of the state, and in like manner all
vacancies in the senate, arising by death, removal out of the state, or otherwise, shall be supplied
as soon as may be after such vacancies happen.
     Provided nevertheless, That no person shall be capable of being elected a senator, who is
not of the protestant religion, and seized of a freehold estate in his own right of the value of two
hundred pounds, lying within this state, who is not of the age of thirty years, and who shall not
have been an inhabitant of this state for seven years immediately preceding his election; and at the
time thereof he shall be an inhabitant of the district for which he shall be chosen.
     THE senate shall have power to adjourn themselves, provided such adjournment do not
exceed two days at a time.
     THE senate shall appoint their own officers, and determine their own rules of proceedings.
And not less than seven members of the senate shall make a quorum for doing business; and when
less than eight senators shall be present, the assent of five at least shall be necessary to render
their acts and proceedings valid.
     The senate shall be a court with full power and authority to hear and determine all
impeachments made by the house of representatives, against any officer or officers of the state,
for misconduct, or mal-administration in their offices. But previous to the trial of any such
impeachment, the members of the senate shall respectively be sworn, truly and impartially to try
and determine the charge in question according to evidence. Their judgment, however, shall not
extend farther than removal from office, disqualification to hold or enjoy any place of honor, trust
or profit under this state; but the party so convicted, shall nevertheless be liable to indictment,
trial, judgment, and punishment, according to laws of the land.

     HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

     THERE shall be in the legislature of this state a representation of the people annually
elected and founded upon principles of equality: and in order that such representation may be as
equal as circumstances will admit, every town, parish or place intitled to town privileges, having
one hundred and fifty rateable male polls, of twenty-one years of age, and upwards, may elect one
representative; if four hundred and fifty rateable polls, may elect two representatives; and so
proceeding in that proportion, making three hundred such rateable polls the mean increasing

meeting shall be held in the town, parish, or place wherein most of the rateable polls reside; and
afterwards in that which has the next highest number, and so on annually by rotation, through the
several towns, parishes or places, forming the district.
     WHENEVER any town, parish, or place intitled to town privileges as aforesaid, shall not
have one hundred and fifty rateable poles, and be so situated as to render the classing thereof with
any other town, parish, or place very inconvenient, the general-assembly may upon application of
a majority of the voters in such town, parish, or place, issue a writ for their electing and sending a
representative to the general-court.
     THE members of the house of representatives shall be chosen annually in the month of
March, and shall be the second branch of the legislature.
     ALL persons qualified to vote in the election of senators shall be intitled to vote within the
town, district, parish, or place where they dwell, in the choice of representatives. Every member
of the house of representatives shall be chosen by ballot; and for two years at least next preceding
his election, shall have been an inhabitant of this state, shall have an estate within the town, parish,
or place which he may be chosen to represent, of the value of one hundred pounds, one half of

inhabitant of the town, parish, or place he may be chosen to represent; shall be of the protestant
religion, and shall cease to represent such town, parish, or place immediately on his ceasing to be
qualified as aforesaid.
     THE travel of each representative to the general-assembly,* and returning home, once in
every session, aind no more, shall be at the expence of the state, and the wages for his attendance,

and not departing without licence. All intermediate vacancies in the house of Representatives, may
be filled up from time to time, in the same manner as annual elections are made.
     THE house of representatives shall be the grand inquest of the state, and all
impeachments made by them, shall be heard and tried by the senate.
     ALL money bills shall originate in the house of representatives, but the senate may
propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.
     THE house of representatives shall have power to adjourn themselves, but no longer than
two days at a time.
     A majority of the members of the house of representatives shall be a quorum for doing
business; but when less than two-thirds of the representatives elected shall be present, the assent
of two-thirds of those members shall be necessary to render their acts and proceedings valid.
     No member of the house of representatives or senate, shall be arrested or held to bail on
mean process, during his going to, returning from, or attendance upon the court.
     THE house of representatives shall choose their own speaker, appoint their own officers,
