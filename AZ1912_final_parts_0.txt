shall exercise the powers properly belonging to either of the others.

Section 1.  (1) The legislative authority of the State shall be vested in a Legislature consisting of
a Senate and a House of Representatives. but the people reserve the power to propose laws and
amendments to the Constitution and to enact or reject such laws and amendments at the polls,
independently of the Legislature; and they also reserve, for use at their own option, the power to
approve or reject at the polls any Act, or item, section, or part of any Act, of the Legislature.

     (2) The first of these reserved powers is the Initiative.  Under this power ten per centum
of the qualified electors shall have the right to propose any measure, and fifteen per centum shall
have the right to propose any amendment to the Constitution.

     (3) The second of these reserved is the Referendum.  Under this power of the Legislature,
or five per centum of the qualified electors, may order the submission to the people at the polls of
any measure, or item, section, or part of any measure, enacted by the Legislature, except laws
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or for the
support and maintenance of the departments of the State governments and State institutions; but
to allow opportunity for Referendum Petitions, no Act passed by the Legislature shall be
operative for ninety days after the close of the session of the Legislature enacting such measure,
except such as require earlier operation to preserve the public peace, health, or safety, or to
provide appropriations for the support and maintenance of the Departments of State and of State
institutions; provided, that no such emergency measure shall be considered passed by the
Legislature unless it shall state in the operative section why it is necessary that it shall become
immediately operative, and shall be approved by the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the
members elected to each House of the Legislature, taken by roll call of ayes and nays, and also
approved by the Governor; and should such measure be vetoed by the Governor, it shall not
become a law unless it shall be approved by votes of three-fourths of the members elected to
each House of the Legislature, taken by roll call of ayes and nays.

     (4) All petitions submitted under the power of the Initiative shall be known as Initiative
Petitions, and shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than four months preceding the
date of the election at which the measures so proposed are to be voted upon.  All petitions
submitted under the power of the Referendum shall be known as Referendum Petitions, and shall
be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after the final adjournment of the
session of the Legislature which shall have passed the measure to which the Referendum is
applied.  The filing of a Referendum Petition against any item, section, or part of any measure
shall not prevent the remainder of such measure from becoming operative.

     (5) Any measure or amendment to the Constitution proposed under the Initiative, and any
measure to which the Initiative is applied, shall be referred to a vote of the qualified electors, and
shall become law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and upon proclamation
of the Governor and not otherwise.

     (6) The veto power of the Governor shall not extend to Initiative or Referendum measures
approved by a majority of the qualified electors.

     (7) The whole number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor at the general election
last preceding the filing of any Initiative or Referendum petition on a state or county measure
shall be the basis on which the number of qualified electors required to sign such petition shall be
computed.

     (8) The power of the Initiative and the Referendum are hereby further reserved to the
qualified electors of every incorporated city, town, and county as to all local, city, town, or
county matters on which incorporated cities, towns, and counties are or shall be empowered by
general laws to legislate.  Such incorporated cities, towns, and counties may prescribe the manner
of exercising said powers within the restrictions of the general laws.  Under the power of the
Initiative fifteen per centum of the qualified electors may propose measures on such local, city,
town, or county matters, and ten per centum of the electors may propose the Referendum on
legislation enacted with and by such city, town, or county.  Until provided by general law, said
cities and towns may prescribe the basis on which said percentages shall be computed.

     (9) Every Initiative or Referendum petition shall be addressed to the Secretary of State in
the case of petitions for or on State measures, and to the clerk of the Board of Supervisors, city
clerk, or corresponding officer in the case of petitions for or on county, city, or town measures;
and shall contain the declaration of each petitioner, for himself, that he is a qualified elector of
the State (and in the case of petitions for or on city, town, or county measures, of the city, town,
or county affected), his post office address, the street and number, if any, of his residence, and
the date on which he signed the petition.  Each sheet containing petitioners' signatures shall be
attached to a full and correct copy of the title and text of the measure so proposed to be initiated
or referred to the people, and every sheet or every such petition containing signatures shall be
verified by the affidavit of the person who circulated said sheet or petition, setting forth that each
of the names on said sheet was signed in the presence of the affiant and that in the belief of the
affiant each signer was a qualified elector of the State, or in the case of a city, town, or county
measure, of the city, county, or town affected by the measure so proposed to be initiated or
referred to the people.

     (10) When any Initiative or Referendum petition or any measure referred to the people by
the Legislature, shall be filed, in accordance with this section, with the Secretary of State, he
shall cause to be printed on the official ballot at the next regular general election the title and
number of said measure, together with the words "Yes" and "No" in such manner that the
electors may express at the polls their approval or disapproval of the measure.

     (11) The text of all measures to be submitted shall be published as proposed amendments
to the Constitution are published, and in submitting such measures and proposed amendments the
Secretary of State and all other officers shall be guided by the general law until legislation shall
be especially provided therefor.

     (12) If two or more conflicting measures or amendments to the Constitution shall be
approved by the people at the same election, the measure or amendment receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail in all particulars as to which there is conflict.

     (13) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State, in the presence of the Governor and the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to canvass the votes for and against each of such measures or
proposed amendments to the Constitution within thirty days after the election, and upon the
completion of the canvass the Governor shall forthwith issue a proclamation, giving the whole
number of votes cast for and against each measure or proposed amendment, and declaring such
measures or amendments as are approved by a majority of those voting thereon to be law.

     (14) This section shall not be construed to deprive the Legislature of the right to enact any
measure.

     (15) This section of the Constitution shall be, in all respects, self-executing.

of fourteen qualified electors of said city may be elected at large by the qualified electors thereof,
at a general or special election, whose duty it shall be, within ninety days after such election, to
prepare and propose a charter for such city. Such proposed charter shall be signed in duplicate by
the members of such board, or a majority of them, and filed, one copy of said proposed charter
with the chief executive officer of such city and the other with the county recorder of the county
in which said city shall be situated. Such proposed charter shall then be published in one or more
newspapers published, and of general circulation, within said city for at least twenty-one days if
in a daily paper, or in three consecutive issues if in a weekly paper, and the first publication shall
be made within twenty days after the completion of the proposed charter. Within thirty days, and
not earlier than twenty days, after such publication, said proposed charter shall be submitted to
the vote of the qualified electors of said city at a general or special election. If a majority of such
qualified electors voting thereon shall ratify such proposed charter, it shall thereupon be
submitted to the governor for his approval, and the governor shall approve it if it shall not be in
conflict with this Constitution or with the laws of the state. Upon such approval said charter shall
become the organic law of such city and supersede any charter then existing (and all amendments
thereto), and all ordinances inconsistent with said new charter. A copy of such charter, certified
by the chief executive officer, and authenticated by the seal, of such city, together with a
statement similarly certified and authenticated setting forth the submission of such charter to the
electors and its ratification by them, shall, after the approval of such charter by the governor, be
made in duplicate and filed, one copy in the office of the secretary of state and the other in the
archives of the city after being recorded in the office of said county recorder. Thereafter all courts
shall take judicial notice of said charter.

The charter so ratified may be amended by amendments proposed and submitted by the
legislative authority of the city to the qualified electors thereof (or by petition as hereinafter
provided), at a general or special election, and ratified by a majority of the qualified electors
voting thereon and approved by the governor as herein provided for the approval of the charter.

be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after the final adjournment of the
session of the Legislature which shall have passed the measure to which the Referendum is
applied.  The filing of a Referendum Petition against any item, section, or part of any measure
shall not prevent the remainder of such measure from becoming operative.

     (5) Any measure or amendment to the Constitution proposed under the Initiative, and any
measure to which the Initiative is applied, shall be referred to a vote of the qualified electors, and
shall become law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and upon proclamation
of the Governor and not otherwise.

     (6) The veto power of the Governor, or the power of the Legislature, to repeal and amend,
shall not extend to initiative or referendum measures approved by a majority vote of the qualified
electors.

     (7) The whole number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor at the general election
last preceding the filing of any Initiative or Referendum petition on a state or county measure
shall be the basis on which the number of qualified electors required to sign such petition shall be

     (8) The power of the Initiative and the Referendum are hereby further reserved to the
qualified electors of every incorporated city, town, and county as to all local, city, town, or
county matters on which incorporated cities, towns, and counties are or shall be empowered by
general laws to legislate.  Such incorporated cities, towns, and counties may prescribe the manner
of exercising said powers within the restrictions of the general laws.  Under the power of the
Initiative fifteen per centum of the qualified electors may propose measures on such local, city,
town, or county matters, and ten per centum of the electors may propose the Referendum on
legislation enacted with and by such city, town, or county.  Until provided by general law, said
cities and towns may prescribe the basis on which said percentages shall be computed.

     (9) Every Initiative or Referendum petition shall be addressed to the Secretary of State in
the case of petitions for or on State measures, and to the clerk of the Board of Supervisors, city
clerk, or corresponding officer in the case of petitions for or on county, city, or town measures;
and shall contain the declaration of each petitioner, for himself, that he is a qualified elector of
the State (and in the case of petitions for or on city, town, or county measures, of the city, town,
or county affected), his post office address, the street and number, if any, of his residence, and
the date on which he signed the petition.  Each sheet containing petitioners' signatures shall be
attached to a full and correct copy of the title and text of the measure so proposed to be initiated
or referred to the people, and every sheet or every such petition containing signatures shall be
verified by the affidavit of the person who circulated said sheet or petition, setting forth that each
of the names on said sheet was signed in the presence of the affiant and that in the belief of the
affiant each signer was a qualified elector of the State, or in the case of a city, town, or county
measure, of the city, county, or town affected by the measure so proposed to be initiated or
referred to the people.

     (10) When any Initiative or Referendum petition or any measure referred to the people by
the Legislature, shall be filed, in accordance with this section, with the Secretary of State, he
shall cause to be printed on the official ballot at the next regular general election the title and
number of said measure, together with the words "Yes" and "No" in such manner that the
electors may express at the polls their approval or disapproval of the measure.

     (11) The text of all measures to be submitted shall be published as proposed amendments
to the Constitution are published, and in submitting such measures and proposed amendments the
Secretary of State and all other officers shall be guided by the general law until legislation shall
be especially provided therefor.

     (12) If two or more conflicting measures or amendments to the Constitution shall be
approved by the people at the same election, the measure or amendment receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail in all particulars as to which there is conflict.

     (13) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State, in the presence of the Governor and the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to canvass the votes for and against each of such measures or
proposed amendments to the Constitution within thirty days after the election, and upon the
completion of the canvass the Governor shall forthwith issue a proclamation, giving the whole
number of votes cast for and against each measure or proposed amendment, and declaring such
measures or amendments as are approved by a majority of those voting thereon to be law.

     (14) This section shall not be construed to deprive the Legislature of the right to enact any
measure.

     (15) This section of the Constitution shall be, in all respects, self-executing.

     from the state to a political subdivision of this state, the appropriations percentage
     limitation may by commensurately decreased, and the tax rates of the political
     subdivision may be commensurately increased.

          3. If federal taxes are reduced on condition that the state increase expenditures by an
     amount equivalent to the federal reduction, the appropriation percentage limitation may
     be increased by such amount.

          4.  If the costs of a program are transferred from the state to the federal government, the
     appropriation percentage limitation shall be commensurately decreased.

          5.  The adjustment provided for in this section shall be made in the first fiscal year of

     agencies, departments, offices, boards, commissions, authorities, councils and insitutions

                    (i) Any amounts or property received from the issuance or incurrence of bonds or
          other lawful long-term obligations issued or incurred for a specific purpose. For
          the purpose of this subdivision long-term obligations shall not include warrants
          issued in the ordinary course of operation or registered for payment by the state.

          (ii) Any amounts or property received as payment of dividends or interest.

                    (iii) Any amounts or property received by the state in the capacity of trustee,

          property or as consideration for services or the use of property.

                    (viii) Any amounts received pursuant to a transfer during a fiscal year from
          another agency, department, office, board, commission, authority, council or
          institution of the state which were included as state revenues for such fiscal year
          or which are excluded from state revenue under other provisions of this
          subsection.

                    (ix) Any amounts attributable to an increase in the rates of tax subsequent to July
          1, 1979 on vehicle users, gasoline and diesel fuel which were levied on July 1,

                    (x) Any amounts received during a fiscal year as refunds, reimbursements or other

          other provisions of this subsection.

(3) The legislature shall not appropriate for any fiscal year state revenues in excess of seven per
cent of the total personal income of the state for that fiscal year as determined by the economic

of the limitation. If the legislature authorizes a specific dollar amount of appropriation for more
than one fiscal year, for the purpose of measuring such appropriation against the appropriation
limitation, the entire amount appropriated shall be applied against the limitation in the first fiscal
year during which any expenditures are authorized, and in no other fiscal year.

(4) In order to permit the transference of governmental functions or funding responsibilities
between the federal and state governments and between the state government and its political
subdivisions without abridging the purpose of this section to limit state appropriations to a
percentage of total personal income, the legislature shall provide for adjustments of the
appropriation percentage limitation consistent with the following principles:

          (a) If the federal government assumes all or any part of the cost of providing a
     governmental function which the state previously funded in whole or in part, the
     appropriation limitation shall be commensurately decreased.

          (b) If the federal government requires the state to assume all or any part of the cost of
     providing a governmental function the appropriation limitation shall be commensurately
     increased.

          (c) If the state assumes all or any part of the cost of providing a governmental function
     and the state requires the political subdivision, which previously funded all or any part of
     the cost of the function to commensurately decrease its tax revenues, the appropriation
     percentage limitation shall be commensurately increased.

          (d) If a political subdivision assumes all or any part of the cost of providing a
     governmental function previously funded in whole or in part by the state, the
     appropriation percentage limitation shall be commensurately decreased.

Any adjustments made pursuant to this subsection shall be made for the first fiscal year of the
assumption of the cost. Such adjustment shall remain in effect for each subsequent fiscal year.

20. Expenditure limitation; adjustments; reporting

Section 20. (1) The economic estimates commission shall determine and publish prior to April 1
of each year the expenditure limitation for the following fiscal year for each county, city and
town.  The expenditure limitations shall be determined by adjusting the amount of actual
payments of local revenues for each such political subdivision for the fiscal year 1979-1980 to
reflect the changes in the population of each political subdivision and the cost of living.  The
governing board of any political subdivision shall not authorize expenditures of local revenues in
excess of the limitation prescribed in this section, except as provided in subsections (2), (6) and
(9) of this section.

     (2) Expenditures in excess of the limitations determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section may be authorized as follows:

          (a) Upon affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the governing board for
     expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or man-made disaster declared by the
     Governor.  Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by this
     paragraph, shall not affect the determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to
     subsection (1) of this section in any subsequent years.  Any expenditures authorized
     pursuant to this paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in which the disaster is
     declared or in the succeeding fiscal year.

          (b) Upon the affirmative vote of seventy per cent of the members of the governing board
     for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural of man-made disaster not declared by
     the Governor subject to the following:

                    (i) The governing board reducing expenditures below the expenditure limitation
          determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section by the amount of the excess
          expenditure for the fiscal year following a fiscal year in which excess
          expenditures were made pursuant to this paragraph; or

                    (ii) Approval of the excess expenditure by a majority of the qualified voters either
          at a special election held by the governing board or at a regularly scheduled
          election for the nomination or election of the members of the governing board, in
          the manner provided by law.  If the excess expenditure is not approved by a
          majority of the qualified electors voting, the governing board shall for the fiscal
          year which immediately follows the fiscal year in which the excess expenditures
          are made, reduce expenditures below the expenditure limitation determined
          pursuant to subsection (1) of this section by the amount of the excess
          expenditures.  Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure limitation, as
          authorized by this paragraph, shall not affect the determination of the expenditure
          limitation pursuant to section (1) of this section in any subsequent years.  Any
          expenditures pursuant to this paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in
          which the disaster occurs or in the following fiscal year.

          (c) Upon affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the governing board and approval by a
     majority of the qualified electors voting either a special election held by the governing
     board in a manner prescribed by law, or at a regularly scheduled election for the
     nomination or election of the members of the governing board.  Such approval by a
     majority of the qualified electors shall be for a specific amount in excess of the
     expenditure limitation, and such approval must occur prior to the fiscal year in which the
     expenditure limitation shall be exceeded.  Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure
     limitations, as authorized by this subdivision, shall not affect the determination of the
     expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this section in subsequent years.

a manner provided by law, the impact of the alternative expenditure limitation shall be compared
to the impact of the expenditure limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section, and the
comparison shall appear on the ballot and in publicity pamphlets.  If a majority of the qualified
electors voting on such issue vote in favor of the alternative expenditure limitation, such

(1) of this section shall become the expenditure limitation for the city or town unless an
alternative expenditure limitation is approved as provided in this subsection.  If a majority of the
qualified electors voting on such issue vote against an alternative expenditure limitation, the
expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall apply to the city
or town, and no new alternative expenditure limitation may be submitted to voters for a period of
at least two years.  If an alternative expenditure limitation is adopted pursuant to this subsection,
the city or town may not conduct an override election provided for in section 19, subsection (4)
of this article, during the time period in which the alternative expenditure limitation is in effect.

     (10) This section does not apply to any political subdivision until the fiscal year
immediately following the first regularly scheduled election after July 1, 1980 for the nomination
or election of the members of the governing board of such political subdivision, except that a
political subdivision, prior to the fiscal year during which the spending limitation would first
become effective, may modify the expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of
this section, by the provisions prescribed by subsections (2) and (6) of this section, or may adopt
an alternative expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.
     A county may conduct a special election to exceed the expenditure limitation prescribed
pursuant to subsection (1) of this section for the fiscal years 1982-1983 and 1983-1984, on the
first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in 1981.

     (11) "City" as used in this article, means city or charter city.

employer knowingly and purposely with the direct object of injuring another, and the act
indicates a wilful disregard of the life, limb or bodily safety of employees, then such employee
may, after the injury, exercise the option to accept compensation or to retain the right to sue the
person who injured him.

The percentages and amounts of compensation provided in house bill no. 227 enacted by the

     of living, and multiplying the result by 1.10. The aggregate expenditures of local revenues
     for all school districts shall not exceed the limitation prescribed in this section, except as

secretary of state and the secretary of state shall submit to the qualified electors at the next
regular general election the question, "Shall the recommendations of the commission on salaries
for elective state officers concerning legislative salaries be accepted? [ ] Yes [ ] No." Such

                    (b) Upon the affirmative vote of seventy per cent of the members of the governing
          board for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or man-made disaster not

                              (i) The governing board reducing expenditures below the expenditure
               limitation determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section by the

               electors voting either at a special election held by the governing board or
               at a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of the
               members of the governing board, in the manner provided by law. If the
               excess expenditure is not approved by a majority of the qualified electors
               voting, the governing board shall for the fiscal year which immediately
               follows the fiscal year in which the excess expenditures are made, reduce
               expenditures below the expenditure limitation determined pursuant to
               subsection (1) of this section by the amount of the excess expenditures.
               Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by
               this paragraph, shall not affect the determination of the expenditure
               limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this section in any subsequent
               years. Any expenditures pursuant to this paragraph shall be made either in
               the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs or in the succeeding fiscal year.

                    (c) Upon affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the governing

          election held by the governing board in a manner prescribed by law, or at a
          regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of the members of the
          governing board. Such approval by a majority of the qualified electors voting shall
          be for a specific amount in excess of the expenditure limitation, and such approval
          must occur prior to the fiscal year in which the expenditure limitation is to be
          exceeded. Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure limitation, as authorized
          by this subdivision, shall not affect the determination of the expenditure limitation
          pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, in subsequent years.

               applied against the expenditure limitation for such fiscal year or which
               were excluded from local revenues under other provisions of this
               subsection.

                              (xiv) Any amounts received collected by the counties for distribution to
               school districts pursuant to state law.

                    (e) "Political subdivision" means any county, city or town. This definition applies
          only to this section and does not otherwise modify the commonly accepted
          definition of political subdivision.

          (f) "Population" means either:

                              (i) The periodic census conducted by the United States department of
               commerce or its successor agency, or the annual update of such census by
               the department of economic security or its successor agency.

                              (ii) A different measure or index of population adopted at the direction of
               the legislature, by concurrent resolution, upon affirmative vote of
               two-thirds of the membership of each house of the legislature. Such
               measure or index shall apply for subsequent fiscal years, except it shall not
               apply for the fiscal year following the adoption of such measure or index if
               the measure or index is adopted after March 1 of the preceding fiscal year.

                    (4) The economic estimates commission shall adjust the base limit to reflect
          subsequent transfers of all or any part of the cost of providing a governmental
          function, in a manner prescribed by law. The adjustment provided for in this
          subsection shall be used in determining the expenditure limitation pursuant to
          subsection (1) of this section beginning with the fiscal year immediately following
          the transfer.

                    (5) The economic estimates commission shall adjust the base limit to reflect any
          subsequent annexation, creation of a new political subdivision, consolidation or
          change in the boundaries of a political subdivision, in a manner prescribed by law.
          The adjustment provided for in this subsection shall be used in determining the
          expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this section beginning with
          the fiscal year immediately following the annexation, creation of a new political
          subdivision, consolidation or change in the boundaries of a political subdivision.

                    (6) Any political subdivision may adjust the base limit by the affirmative vote of
          two-thirds of the members of the governing board or by initiative, in the manner
          provided by law, and in either instance by approval of the proposed adjustment by
          a majority of the qualified electors voting at a regularly scheduled general election
          or at a nonpartisan election held for the nomination or election of the members of
          the governing board. The impact of the modification of the expenditure limitation
          shall appear on the ballot and in publicity pamphlets, as provided by law. Any
          adjustment, pursuant to this subsection, of the base limit shall be used in
          determining the expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
          beginning with the fiscal year immediately following the approval, as provided by
          law.

                    (7) The legislature shall provide for expenditure limitations for such special
          districts as it deems necessary.

                    (8) The legislature shall establish by law a uniform reporting system for all
          political subdivisions or special districts subject to an expenditure limitation
          pursuant to this section to insure compliance with this section. The legislature
          shall establish by law sanctions and penalties for failure to comply with this
          section.

                    (9) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a city or town which at a
          regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of members of the
          governing board of the city or town adopts an expenditure limitation pursuant to
          this subsection different from the expenditure limitation prescribed by subsection
          (1) of this section. The governing board of a city or town may by a two-thirds vote
          provide for referral of an alternative expenditure limitation or the qualified
          electors may by initiative, in the manner provided by law, propose an alternative
          expenditure limitation. In a manner provided by law, the impact of the alternative
          expenditure limitation shall be compared to the impact of the expenditure
          limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section, and the comparison shall
          appear on the ballot and in publicity pamphlets. If a majority of the qualified
          electors voting on such issue vote in favor of the alternative expenditure
          limitation, such limitation shall apply to the city or town. If more than one
          alternative expenditure limitation is on the ballot and more than one alternative
          expenditure limitation is approved by the voters, the alternative expenditure
          limitation receiving the highest number of votes shall apply to such city or town.
          If an alternative expenditure limitation is adopted, it shall apply for the four
          succeeding fiscal years. Following the fourth succeeding fiscal year, the
          expenditure limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section shall become
          the expenditure limitation for the city or town unless an alternative expenditure
          limitation is approved as provided in this subsection. If a majority of the qualified
          electors voting on such issue vote against an alternative expenditure limitation,
          the expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
          shall apply to the city or town, and no new alternative expenditure limitation may
          be submitted to the voters for a period of at least two years. If an alternative
          expenditure limitation is adopted pursuant to this subsection, the city or town may
          not conduct an override election provided for in section 19, subsection (4) of this
          article, during the time period in which the alternative expenditure limitation is in
          effect.

                    (10) This section does not apply to any political subdivision until the fiscal year
          immediately following the first regularly scheduled election after July 1, 1980 for
          the nomination or election of the members of the governing board of such
          political subdivision, except that a political subdivision, prior to the fiscal year
          during which the spending limitation would first become effective, may modify
          the expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, by
          the provisions prescribed by subsections (2) and (6) of this section, or may adopt
          an alternative expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.

                    A county may conduct a special election to exceed the expenditure limitation
          prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section for the fiscal years 1982-1983
          and 1983-1984, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in 1981.

          (11) "City", as used in this article, means city or charter city.

5. Charter committee; charter preparation; approval

Section 5. A. The board of supervisors of any county with a population of more than five
hundred thousand persons as determined by the most recent United States decennial or special
census may call for an election to cause a charter committee to be elected by the qualified
electors of that county at any time. Alternatively, the board of supervisors of any county with a
population of more than five hundred thousand persons as determined by the most recent United
States decennial or special census shall call for the election of the charter committee within ten
days after receipt by the clerk of the board of supervisors of a petition that demands the election
and that is signed by a number of qualified electors of the county at least equal to ten per cent of
the total number of ballots cast for all candidates for governor or presidential electors in the
county at the last preceding general election. The election shall be held at least one hundred days
but not more than one hundred twenty days after the call for the election. Except as otherwise
provided in this section, for elections held under this section or section 6 of this article, the
manner of conducting and voting at an election, contesting an election, canvassing votes and
certifying returns shall be the same, as nearly as practicable, as in elections for county officers.

B. At the election a vote shall be taken to elect members of the charter committee who will
function if further proceedings are authorized and the ballot shall contain the question of whether
further proceedings toward adopting a charter shall be authorized pursuant to the call for the
election. Unless a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question votes to authorize
further proceedings, the election of members of the charter committee shall be invalidated and no
further proceedings may be had except pursuant to a subsequent call pursuant to subsection A.

C. The charter committee shall be composed of fifteen qualified electors of the county elected by
supervisorial district with the same number serving from each district. A nomination petition for
election to the charter committee shall be made available by the clerk of the board of supervisors
and shall be signed by a number of qualified electors of the supervisorial district who are eligible
to vote for the nominee at least equal to one per cent of the total number of ballots cast for all
candidates for governor or presidential electors in the supervisorial district at the last preceding
general election, and filed with the clerk not later than sixty days before the election. All
qualified electors of the county, including all elected public officials, are eligible to seek election
to the charter committee.

D. Within one hundred eighty days after the election the charter committee shall prepare and
submit a proposed charter for the county. The proposed charter shall be signed by a majority of
the members of the committee and filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors, after which
the charter committee shall be dissolved. The county shall then publish the proposed charter in
the official newspaper of the county at least once a week for three consecutive weeks. The first
publication shall be made within twenty days after the proposed charter is filed with the clerk of
the board of supervisors.

E. At least forty-five days but not more than sixty days after final publication, the proposed
charter shall be submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county at a general or special
election. If a general election will be held within ninety days after final publication, the charter
shall be submitted at that general election. The full text of the proposed charter shall be printed in
a publicity pamphlet and mailed to each household containing a registered voter at least eleven
days before the charter election and the ballot may contain only a summary of the proposed
charter provisions. The ballot shall contain a question regarding approval of the proposed charter
and the questions pertaining to taxation authority and appointment of officers, if any, provided
for in sections 7 and 8 of this article.

F. If a majority of the qualified electors voting ratifies the proposed charter, a copy of the charter,
together with a statement setting forth the submission of the charter to the qualified electors and
its ratification by them, shall be certified by the clerk of the board of supervisors and shall be
submitted to the governor for approval. The governor shall approve the charter within thirty days
after its submission if it is not in conflict with, or states that in the event of a conflict is subject
to, this constitution and the laws of this state. On approval, the charter becomes the organic law
of the county, and certified copies of the charter shall be filed in the office of the secretary of
state and with the clerk of the board of supervisors after being recorded in the office of the
county recorder. Thereafter all courts shall take judicial notice of the charter.

7. County charter provisions

Section 7. A. Charter counties continue to be political subdivisions of this state that exist to aid
in the administration of this state's laws and for purposes of self-government. Except as
otherwise provided in this article the powers of the legislature over counties are not affected by
this section and sections 5, 6, 8 and 9 of this article. Charter counties shall provide the same state
mandated services and perform the same state mandated functions as non-charter counties.
Charter counties may exercise, if provided by the charter, all powers over local concerns of the
county consistent with, and subject to, the constitution and the laws of this state. In matters of
strictly local municipal concern, charters adopted pursuant to article XIII shall control in any case
of conflict with a county charter adopted pursuant to this article.

B. If a county has framed and adopted a charter and the charter is approved by the governor as
provided in this article, the county shall be governed by the terms of its charter and ordinances
passed pursuant to its charter. If the charter has been framed, adopted and approved and any of its
provisions are in conflict with any county ordinance, rule or regulation relating to local concerns
of the counties in force at the time of the adoption and approval of the charter, the provisions of
the charter prevail notwithstanding the conflict and operate as a repeal or suspension of the law
to the extent of conflict, and the law is not thereafter operative as to such conflict.

C. Notwithstanding article IX, section 1, if proposed and approved in the charter, a charter county
may levy and collect:

          1. Taxes on a countywide basis to provide services on a countywide basis.

          2. Taxes on a specially designated area basis to provide services or special levels of
     service to that area.

All taxes levied pursuant to this subsection shall be uniform upon the same class of property
within the territorial limits of the county or the specially designated area and shall be levied and
collected for public purposes only.

D. The decision to include a charter provision authorizing taxation pursuant to subsection C,
paragraph 1 or 2 of this section shall be placed on the ballot as separate questions at the election
to ratify the charter and must be approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting at the
election. The result of the voting on either provision authorizing taxation does not affect the
result of the voting to ratify the charter. Charter provisions authorizing taxation pursuant to
subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section may also be proposed by an amendment to the
charter pursuant to section 6 of this article.

E. If the authority to tax pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section is approved for
inclusion in the charter, any new tax proposed by the county under subsection C, paragraph 2 of
this section shall be voted on by the qualified electors of the specially designated area. The tax
must be ratified by a majority vote of the qualified electors voting at the election.

F. A transaction privilege tax, use tax or similar tax levied by a county pursuant to subsection C,
paragraph 1 of this section:

          1. May be imposed on only those business activities, or on the use, storage or
     consumption, which are subject to the comparable state transaction privilege tax, use tax
     or similar tax.

          2. Shall provide all exclusion and exemptions provided by, and administrative provisions
     consistent with, the comparable state transaction privilege tax, use tax or similar tax.

G. All taxes levied under subsection F of this section shall not exceed an aggregate rate of two
per cent when combined with existing taxes levied pursuant to title 42, chapter 8.3.

H. If approved in the charter, a charter county may adopt fees and fee schedules for any county
products and county service delivery it provides in the conduct of any official business.
Notwithstanding any fee schedules or individual charges provided by state law, the governing
body of a charter county may adopt an alternate fee schedule or individual charge. Any fee or
charge established pursuant to this section shall be attributable to and defray or cover the current
or future costs of the product or service delivery for which the fee or charge is assessed.

I. Taxes raised under the authority of this section shall be subject to the provisions of the county
property tax and expenditure limitations pursuant to article IX, sections 19 and 20.

8. Government and other powers

Section 8. A. The county charter shall provide:

          1. For an elective governing body and its method of compensation, its powers, duties and
     responsibilities, its authority to delegate powers, the method of election and removal of
     members, the terms of office and the manner of filling vacancies in the governing body.

          2. For all officers established under section 3 of this article and article VI, section 23, and
     such additional officers as the charter may provide for, their election or appointment,
     consolidation or segregation, method of compensation, powers, duties and
     responsibilities, authority to delegate powers and, if elected, the method of election and
     removal, terms of office and the manner of filling vacancies in such offices. If the charter
     provides for the attorney to remain an elective officer of the county, the charter may
     provide for an appointive office to carry out the civil representation needs of the county,
     its departments, agencies, boards, commissions, officials and employees. If the elective
     governing body provided for in the charter does not consist of supervisors, the charter
     may provide for elimination of the office of supervisor. If the charter provides for the
     office of supervisor, the number of supervisors shall be not fewer than five or greater than
     nine. If the charter provides for the appointment or elimination of an officer established
     under section 3 of this article or article VI, section 23, or for an appointive office to carry
     out the civil representation needs of the county, those provisions shall include an effective
     date not earlier than the expiration of the term of office for the officer commencing in
     January immediately following the first general election at which the officer is elected
     following approval of the charter by the voters and shall be placed on the ballot as
     separate questions at the election to ratify the charter and must be approved by a majority
     of the qualified electors voting at the election. The result of the voting on any provisions
     authorizing appointment or elimination of officers does not affect the result of the voting
     to ratify the charter.

     3. For the performance of functions required by statute.

          4. For a periodic review of the charter provisions to be conducted at least once every ten
     years from the time of its ratification by the voters and the procedures for the periodic
     review.

B. The county charter may provide for other elective and appointive offices.

Part 1.

1. Legislative authority; initiative and referendum

     Section 1. (1) Senate; house of representatives; reservation of power to people. The legislative
     authority of the state shall be vested in the legislature, consisting of a senate and a house
     of representatives, but the people reserve the power to propose laws and amendments to
     the constitution and to enact or reject such laws and amendments at the polls,
     independently of the legislature; and they also reserve, for use at their own option, the
     power to approve or reject at the polls any act, or item, section, or part of any act, of the
     legislature.

          (2) Initiative power. The first of these reserved powers is the initiative. Under this power
     ten per centum of the qualified electors shall have the right to propose any measure, and
     fifteen per centum shall have the right to propose any amendment to the constitution.

          (3) Referendum power; emergency measures; effective date of acts. The second of these
     reserved powers is the referendum. Under this power the legislature, or five per centum of
     the qualified electors, may order the submission to the people at the polls of any measure,
     or item, section, or part of any measure, enacted by the legislature, except laws
     immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or for
     the support and maintenance of the departments of the state government and state
     institutions; but to allow opportunity for referendum petitions, no act passed by the
     legislature shall be operative for ninety days after the close of the session of the
     legislature enacting such measure, except such as require earlier operation to preserve the
     public peace, health, or safety, or to provide appropriations for the support and
     maintenance of the departments of the state and of state institutions; provided, that no
     such emergency measure shall be considered passed by the legislature unless it shall state
     in a separate section why it is necessary that it shall become immediately operative, and
     shall be approved by the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the members elected to each
     house of the legislature, taken by roll call of ayes and nays, and also approved by the
     governor; and should such measure be vetoed by the governor, it shall not become a law
     unless it shall be approved by the votes of three-fourths of the members elected to each
     house of the legislature, taken by roll call of ayes and nays.

          (4) Initiative and referendum petitions; filing. All petitions submitted under the power of
     the initiative shall be known as initiative petitions, and shall be filed with the secretary of
     state not less than four months preceding the date of the election at which the measures so
     proposed are to be voted upon. All petitions submitted under the power of the referendum
     shall be known as referendum petitions, and shall be filed with the secretary of state not
     more than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature which
     shall have passed the measure to which the referendum is applied. The filing of a
     referendum petition against any item, section, or part of any measure shall not prevent the
     remainder of such measure from becoming operative.

          (5) Effective date of initiative and referendum measures. Any measure or amendment to
     the constitution proposed under the initiative, and any measure to which the referendum
     is applied, shall be referred to a vote of the qualified electors, and shall become law when
     approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and upon proclamation of the governor,
     and not otherwise.

               (6)  (A) Veto of initiative or referendum. The veto power of the governor shall not
          extend to an initiative measure approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon or
          to a referendum measure decided by a majority of the votes cast thereon.

                    (6) (B) Legislature's power to repeal initiative or referendum. The legislature shall
          not have the power to repeal an initiative measure approved by a majority of the
          votes cast thereon or to repeal a referendum measure decided by a majority of the
          votes cast thereon.

                    (6) (C) Legislature's power to amend initiative or referendum. The legislature
          shall not have the power to amend an initiative measure approved by a majority of
          the votes cast thereon, or to amend a referendum measure decided by a majority of
          the votes cast thereon, unless the amending legislation furthers the purposes of
          such measure and at least three-fourths of the members of each house of the
          legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to amend such measure.

                    (6) (D) Legislature's power to appropriate or divert funds created by initiative or
          referendum. The legislature shall not have the power to appropriate or divert funds
          created or allocated to a specific purpose by an initiative measure approved by a
          majority of the votes cast thereon, or by a referendum measure decided by a
          majority of the votes cast thereon, unless the appropriation or diversion of funds
          furthers the purposes of such measure and at least three-fourths of the members of
          each house of the legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to appropriate or
          divert such funds.

          (7) Number of qualified electors. The whole number of votes cast for all candidates for
     governor at the general election last preceding the filing of any initiative or referendum
     petition on a state or county measure shall be the basis on which the number of qualified
     electors required to sign such petition shall be computed.

          (8) Local, city, town or county matters. The powers of the initiative and the referendum
     are hereby further reserved to the qualified electors of every incorporated city, town, and
     county as to all local, city, town, or county matters on which such incorporated cities,
     towns, and counties are or shall be empowered by general laws to legislate. Such
     incorporated cities, towns, and counties may prescribe the manner of exercising said
     powers within the restrictions of general laws. Under the power of the initiative fifteen
     per centum of the qualified electors may propose measures on such local, city, town, or
     county matters, and ten per centum of the electors may propose the referendum on
     legislation enacted within and by such city, town, or county. Until provided by general
     law, said cities and towns may prescribe the basis on which said percentages shall be
     computed.

          (9) Form and contents of initiative and of referendum petitions; verification. Every
     initiative or referendum petition shall be addressed to the secretary of state in the case of
     petitions for or on state measures, and to the clerk of the board of supervisors, city clerk,
     or corresponding officer in the case of petitions for or on county, city, or town measures;
     and shall contain the declaration of each petitioner, for himself, that he is a qualified
     elector of the state (and in the case of petitions for or on city, town, or county measures,
     of the city, town, or county affected), his post office address, the street and number, if
     any, of his residence, and the date on which he signed such petition. Each sheet
     containing petitioners' signatures shall be attached to a full and correct copy of the title
     and text of the measure so proposed to be initiated or referred to the people, and every
     sheet of every such petition containing signatures shall be verified by the affidavit of the
     person who circulated said sheet or petition, setting forth that each of the names on said
     sheet was signed in the presence of the affiant and that in the belief of the affiant each
     signer was a qualified elector of the state, or in the case of a city, town, or county
     measure, of the city, town, or county affected by the measure so proposed to be initiated
     or referred to the people.

          (10) Official ballot. When any initiative or referendum petition or any measure referred to
     the people by the legislature shall be filed, in accordance with this section, with the
     secretary of state, he shall cause to be printed on the official ballot at the next regular
     general election the title and number of said measure, together with the words "yes" and
     "no" in such manner that the electors may express at the polls their approval or
     disapproval of the measure.

          (11) Publication of measures. The text of all measures to be submitted shall be published
     as proposed amendments to the constitution are published, and in submitting such
     measures and proposed amendments the secretary of state and all other officers shall be
     guided by the general law until legislation shall be especially provided therefor. 

          (12) Conflicting measures or constitutional amendments. If two or more conflicting
     measures or amendments to the constitution shall be approved by the people at the same
     election, the measure or amendment receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes
     shall prevail in all particulars as to which there is conflict.

          (13) Canvass of votes; proclamation. It shall be the duty of the secretary of state, in the
     presence of the governor and the chief justice of the supreme court, to canvass the votes
     for and against each such measure or proposed amendment to the constitution within
     thirty days after the election, and upon the completion of the canvass the governor shall
     forthwith issue a proclamation, giving the whole number of votes cast for and against
     each measure or proposed amendment, and declaring such measures or amendments as
     are approved by a majority of those voting thereon to be law.

          (14) Reservation of legislative power. This section shall not be construed to deprive the
     legislature of the right to enact any measure except that the legislature shall not have the
     power to adopt any measure that supersedes, in whole or in part, any initiative measure
     approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon or any referendum measure decided by a
     majority of the votes cast thereon unless the superseding measure furthers the purposes of
     the initiative or referendum measure and at least three-fourths of the members of each
     house of the legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to supersede such initiative or
     referendum measure.

          (15) Legislature's right to refer measure to the people. Nothing in this section shall be

Part 2.

1. Senate; house of representatives; members; special session upon petition of members;
congressional and legislative boundaries; citizen commissions 

     Section 1. (1) The senate shall be composed of one member elected from each of the thirty
     legislative districts established pursuant to this section.

          The house of representatives shall be composed of two members elected from each of the
     thirty legislative districts established pursuant to this section.

          (2) Upon the presentation to the governor of a petition bearing the signatures of not less
     than two-thirds of the members of each house, requesting a special session of the
     legislature and designating the date of convening, the governor shall promptly call a
     special session to assemble on the date specified. At a special session so called the
     subjects which may be considered by the legislature shall not be limited.

          (3) By February 28 of each year that ends in one, an independent redistricting commission
     shall be established to provide for the redistricting of congressional and state legislative
     districts. The independent redistricting commission shall consist of five members. No
     more than two members of the independent redistricting commission shall be members of
     the same political party. Of the first four members appointed, no more than two shall
     reside in the same county. Each member shall be a registered Arizona voter who has been
     continuously registered with the same political party or registered as unaffiliated with a
     political party for three or more years immediately preceding appointment, who is
     committed to applying the provisions of this section in an honest, independent and
     impartial fashion and to upholding public confidence in the integrity of the redistricting
     process. Within the three years previous to appointment, members shall not have been
     appointed to, elected to, or a candidate for any other public office, including precinct
     committeeman or committeewoman but not including school board member or officer,
     and shall not have served as an officer of a political party, or served as a registered paid
     lobbyist or as an officer of a candidate's campaign committee.

          (4) The commission on appellate court appointments shall nominate candidates for
     appointment to the independent redistricting commission, except that, if a politically
     balanced commission exists whose members are nominated by the commission on
     appellate court appointments and whose regular duties relate to the elective process, the
     commission on appellate court appointments may delegate to such existing commission
     (hereinafter called the commission on appellate court appointments' designee) the duty of
     nominating members for the independent redistricting commission, and all other duties
     assigned to the commission on appellate court appointments in this section.

          (5) By January 8 of years ending in one, the commission on appellate court appointments
     or its designee shall establish a pool of persons who are willing to serve on and are
     qualified for appointment to the independent redistricting commission. The pool of
     candidates shall consist of twenty-five nominees, with ten nominees from each of the two
     largest political parties in Arizona based on party registration, and five who are not
     registered with either of the two largest political parties in Arizona.

          (6) Appointments to the independent redistricting commission shall be made in the order
     set forth below. No later than January 31 of years ending in one, the highest ranking
     officer elected by the Arizona house of representatives shall make one appointment to the
     independent redistricting commission from the pool of nominees, followed by one
     appointment from the pool made in turn by each of the following: the minority party
     leader of the Arizona house of representatives, the highest ranking officer elected by the
     Arizona senate, and the minority party leader of the Arizona senate. Each such official
     shall have a seven-day period in which to make an appointment. Any official who fails to
     make an appointment within the specified time period will forfeit the appointment
     privilege. In the event that there are two or more minority parties within the house or the
     senate, the leader of the largest minority party by statewide party registration shall make
     the appointment.

          (7) Any vacancy in the above four independent redistricting commission positions
     remaining as of March 1 of a year ending in one shall be filled from the pool of nominees
     by the commission on appellate court appointments or its designee. The appointing body
     shall strive for political balance and fairness.

          (8) At a meeting called by the secretary of state, the four independent redistricting
     commission members shall select by majority vote from the nomination pool a fifth
     member who shall not be registered with any party already represented on the
     independent redistricting commission and who shall serve as chair. If the four
     commissioners fail to appoint a fifth member within fifteen days, the commission on
     appellate court appointments or its designee, striving for political balance and fairness,
     shall appoint a fifth member from the nomination pool, who shall serve as chair.

          (9) The five commissioners shall then select by majority vote one of their members to
     serve as vice-chair.

          (10) After having been served written notice and provided with an opportunity for a
     response, a member of the independent redistricting commission may be removed by the
     governor, with the concurrence of two-thirds of the senate, for substantial neglect of duty,
     gross misconduct in office, or inability to discharge the duties of office.

          (11) If a commissioner or chair does not complete the term of office for any reason, the
     commission on appellate court appointments or its designee shall nominate a pool of
     three candidates within the first thirty days after the vacancy occurs. The nominees shall
     be of the same political party or status as was the member who vacated the office at the
     time of his or her appointment, and the appointment other than the chair shall be made by
     the current holder of the office designated to make the original appointment. The
     appointment of a new chair shall be made by the remaining commissioners. If the
     appointment of a replacement commissioner or chair is not made within fourteen days
     following the presentation of the nominees, the commission on appellate court
     appointments or its designee shall make the appointment, striving for political balance
     and fairness. The newly appointed commissioner shall serve out the remainder of the
     original term.

          (12) Three commissioners, including the chair or vice-chair, constitute a quorum. Three
     or more affirmative votes are required for any official action. Where a quorum is present,
     the independent redistricting commission shall conduct business in meetings open to the
     public, with 48 or more hours public notice provided.

          (13) A commissioner, during the commissioner's term of office and for three years
     thereafter, shall be ineligible for Arizona public office or for registration as a paid
     lobbyist.

          (14) The independent redistricting commission shall establish congressional and
     legislative districts. The commencement of the mapping process for both the
     congressional and legislative districts shall be the creation of districts of equal population
     in a grid-like pattern across the state. Adjustments to the grid shall then be made as
     necessary to accommodate the goals as set forth below:

                    A. Districts shall comply with the United States Constitution and the United
          States voting rights act;

                    B. Congressional districts shall have equal population to the extent practicable,
          and state legislative districts shall have equal population to the extent practicable;
     
                    C. Districts shall be geographically compact and contiguous to the extent
          practicable;

                    D. District boundaries shall respect communities of interest to the extent

                    E. To the extent practicable, district lines shall use visible geographic features,
          city, town and county boundaries, and undivided census tracts;

                    F. To the extent practicable, competitive districts should be favored where to do
          so would create no significant detriment to the other goals.

          (15) Party registration and voting history data shall be excluded from the initial phase of
     the mapping process but may be used to test maps for compliance with the above goals.
     The places of residence of incumbents or candidates shall not be identified or considered.

          (16) The independent redistricting commission shall advertise a draft map of
     congressional districts and a draft map of legislative districts to the public for comment,
     which comment shall be taken for at least thirty days. Either or both bodies of the
     legislature may act within this period to make recommendations to the independent
     redistricting commission by memorial or by minority report, which recommendations
     shall be considered by the independent redistricting commission. The independent
     redistricting commission shall then establish final district boundaries.

          (17) The provisions regarding this section are self-executing. The independent
     redistricting commission shall certify to the secretary of state the establishment of
     congressional and legislative districts.

     shall make adequate office space available for the independent redistricting commission.

     the department of administration or its successor shall submit to the legislature a
     recommendation for an appropriation for adequate redistricting expenses and shall make
     available adequate office space for the operation of the independent redistricting
     commission. The legislature shall make the necessary appropriations by a majority vote.

          (19) The independent redistricting commission, with fiscal oversight from the department
     of administration or its successor, shall have procurement and contracting authority and
     may hire staff and consultants for the purposes of this section, including legal
     representation.

          (20) The independent redistricting commission shall have standing in legal actions
     regarding the redistricting plan and the adequacy of resources provided for the operation
     of the independent redistricting commission. The independent redistricting commission
     shall have sole authority to determine whether the Arizona attorney general or counsel
     hired or selected by the independent redistricting commission shall represent the people
     of Arizona in the legal defense of a redistricting plan.

          (21) Members of the independent redistricting commission are eligible for reimbursement
     of expenses pursuant to law, and a member's residence is deemed to be the member's post
     of duty for purposes of reimbursement of expenses.

          (22) Employees of the department of administration or its successor shall not influence or
     attempt to influence the district-mapping decisions of the independent redistricting
     commission.

          (23) Each commissioner's duties established by this section expire upon the appointment
     of the first member of the next redistricting commission. The independent redistricting
     commission shall not meet or incur expenses after the redistricting plan is completed,
     except if litigation or any government approval of the plan is pending, or to revise
     districts if required by court decisions or if the number of congressional or legislative
     districts is changed.

     not exceed four hundred per cent of the supplemental security income benefit rate
     established by section 1611(b)(1) of the social security act. If the property is owned by
     two or more persons, including a husband and wife, at least one of the owners must be
     sixty-five years of age or older and the owners' combined total income from all sources
     including nontaxable income shall not exceed five hundred per cent of the supplemental
     security income benefit rate established by section 1611(b)(1) of the social security act.
     The assessor shall review the owner's income qualifications on a triennial basis and shall
     use the owner's average total income during the previous three years for the review. If the
     county assessor approves a property valuation protection option, the value of the primary
     residence shall remain fixed at the full cash value in effect during the year the property
     valuation protection option is filed and as long as the owner remains eligible. To remain
     eligible, the county assessor shall require a qualifying resident to reapply for the property
     valuation protection option every three years and shall MEND a notice of reapplication to
     qualifying residents six months before the three year reapplication requirement. If title to
     the property is conveyed to any person who does not qualify for the property valuation
     protection option, the property valuation protection option terminates, and the property
     shall revert to its current full cash value.

          (8) The legislature shall provide by law a system of property taxation consistent with the
     provisions of this section. 

          (9) For purposes of this section:

                    (a) "Owner" means the owner of record of the property and includes a person who
          owns the majority beneficial interest of a living trust.

                    (b) "Primary residence" means all owner occupied real property and
          improvements to that real property in this state that is a single family home,
          condominium, townhouse or an owner occupied mobile home and that is used for
          residential purposes.
